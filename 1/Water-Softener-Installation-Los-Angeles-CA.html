<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Los Angeles CA</h3>
<p>In many states, other than Kansas, you are accountable for any natural gas piping on your residential or commercial property from our gas meter to your house or business. Atmos Energy does not keep the natural gas lines on your residential or commercial property beyond our meter, this is the same as other energies, such as your electrical wiring and pipes. When water enters your house from the main supply of water line, it should only ever stream in one direction: into your home.</p>
<p>There are several signs to keep an eye out for. 1) The surface of the floor in one area is warm or perhaps hot to the touch. 2) The dial on your water meter keeps spinning, even when all devices and components in the house have actually been shut off. 3) The water heater seems to be running all the time. 4) All this adds up to higher gas and water costs, sometimes very quickly.</p>
