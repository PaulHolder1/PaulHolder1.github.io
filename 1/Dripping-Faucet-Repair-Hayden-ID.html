<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, discover out. Homes that were developed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how useful, is an ecological toxin (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have children, you may not wish to live in a home that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>You live in an older house. There's a good chance that you'll need to have it done soon if your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually set up in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and wear away when they get old. You may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't already have one if so. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
