Backflow is the unfavorable turnaround of flow of nonpotable water or other substances through a cross-connection and into the piping of a public water system or customer's safe and clean water supply. There are two kinds of backflow - backpressure backflow and backsiphonage.</p>

<p>In some cases called an auger, this useful tool can clear obstructions that may be stuck even more down the system.

This is where you place the snake into the pipe until you feel resistance to break up the clog.</p>
<p>Obligation for installation falls upon the owner of the home or the co-op or condominium board. Owners and boards of structures that are provided an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer should file strategies with the DEP within thirty days.
