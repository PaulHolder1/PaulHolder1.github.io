<p>Follow with a plunger if the baking soda and white vinegar technique does not work. Fill the sink with water and vigorously plunge up and down for several minutes to remove the clog. When working with a double bowl kitchen sink, stuff the other opening with a rag, which helps use additional pressure to the clog. For obstructions that take place further down the pipe, utilize a cable television auger or plumber's snake. These tools are made of long, versatile steel cable wound around a spindle with a hand crank. To use a cable television auger, eliminate the horizontal P-trap underneath the sink, making certain it is not clogged before continuing. Pull out 18 inches of cable at a time, crank the handle in a clockwise instructions and push the auger forward at the exact same time. Repeat the procedure, pulling out an extra 18 inches up until you break through the obstruction. In some cases loose particles will settle into a brand-new clog.
