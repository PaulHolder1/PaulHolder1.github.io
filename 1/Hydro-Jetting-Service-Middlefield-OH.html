<p>Poorly installed gas lines lead to gas leakages. Gas leakages are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself job.

The United States Department of Energy says that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the second highest energy consuming area of a home, next to cooling and heating. The amount of minerals liquified in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>

There are various types and designs of sink faucets, and your Good Guy plumber understands how to repair them all, and can likewise offer installation of a new faucet if required. We have complete confidence that we can manage any type of repair you throw at us.</p>
