<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will build up in various parts of the plumbing system, many commonly in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low flow issues or even stop a component from flowing entirely. The next common problem that happens with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which happens when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so serious that it lowers the available volume of water that can stream around the system.</p>
<p>When you are experiencing problems with your hot water heater, you will want to ensure the concern is quickly dealt with to limit the disturbance to your day and reduce any possible damage from the issue.
