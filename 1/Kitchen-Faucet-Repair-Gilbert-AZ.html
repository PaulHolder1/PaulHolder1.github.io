<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede versus the needed direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. There is capacity for the contaminated water to end up being a health hazard if enabled to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, as well as inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
