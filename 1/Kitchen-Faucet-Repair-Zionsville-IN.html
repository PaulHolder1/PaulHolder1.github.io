<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current double flush HET offered by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.

Appropriate care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its guarantee and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
