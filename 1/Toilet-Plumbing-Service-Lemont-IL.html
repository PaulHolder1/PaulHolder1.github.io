Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed.
