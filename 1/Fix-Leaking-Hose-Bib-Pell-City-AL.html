<p>Inside the house, inspect the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for leakages or drips. Inspect underneath sinks to check for leaking pipes. Local plumber priced quote cost of $400 to install plus cost of garbage disposal. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ happy I checked around.
