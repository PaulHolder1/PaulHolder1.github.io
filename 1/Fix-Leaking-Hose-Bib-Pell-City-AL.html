<p>Inside the house, inspect the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for leakages or drips. Inspect underneath sinks to check for leaking pipes. Local plumber priced quote cost of $400 to install plus cost of garbage disposal. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ happy I checked around. Under the sink, place a bucket or pan beneath the waste pipe, then use locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's waste pipe.

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the offender. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper.
