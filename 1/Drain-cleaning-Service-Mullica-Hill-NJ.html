<p>Other pipe repair methods include our Pipe Pull method and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull technique interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with new piping by the usage of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into location. All brand-new replacement pipes have a predicted life expectancy of one hundred years and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another effective technique is pipe relining. Pipe relining essentially gets rid of the need for broken pipe removal.
