WaterBoss ® uses great mesh resin - smaller beads that actually offer more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to allow maximum capacity in a minimum of space. Plus, our trademarked Directional Flow Screen system helps make sure that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter likewise safeguard the resin bed, so we don't need to squander space on freeboard" which is the empty area in conventional water softeners that permit a churning of resin during regeneration to release firmness, sediment and dirt.</p>

In some cases it may be necessary to filter the water before it gets to your softener to avoid fouling. If the resin ends up being fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Cleaners need to be utilized according to producer guidelines to prevent contamination.</p>
