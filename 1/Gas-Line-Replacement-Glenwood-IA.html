<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that are subject to fouling, wear or fatigue. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be checked periodically to ensure they are functioning effectively. A visual check of air gaps is sufficient, however mechanical backflow preventers have to be tested with properly calibrated gauge devices.</p>
