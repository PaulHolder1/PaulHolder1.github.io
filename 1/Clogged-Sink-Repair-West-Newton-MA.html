<p>The majority of residential houses have roofing system rain gutters that stream into downspout drains that direct water away from your home. When those downspouts are connected to underground drains that flow to local storm drains or street rain gutters, they in some cases become clogged with tree roots and particles. These types of blockages cause rain gutters to overflow and the weight of the water can cause seamless gutters to pull away from a home while causing water damage and rot to the structure. Please note that Roto-Rooter does not clean roofing gutters or rectangle-shaped aluminum gutter downspouts.</p>

This ensures the majority of your plumbing and devices are reaping the benefits of carrying the softened water. It's specifically important to make sure your water softener is located prior to your hot water heater, as hard water does the best damage to warm water appliances. You will want to install the softener in a dry, level location, like a basement or garage. It will need to be near the water's main line, an electrical outlet to switch on the system, and a drain for the salt water option from the regrowth cycle.</p>
