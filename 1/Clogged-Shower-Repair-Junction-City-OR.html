<p>A home's service line (also called a sewer lateral) ranges from the house to the mainline sewer in the street.

<p>Whether you need waste disposal unit repair or installation, Maeser can help. A garbage disposal is an essential kitchen device in the majority of houses today. While many kitchen sink disposers can manage nearly any kind of food waste, they are not indestructible.

These sink switch kits are made to be easily mounted 1, and will typically take your plumber less than an hour to install, at average plumbing costs of around $45-$ 65 per hour.</p>

<p>If there's an existing disposal, use the helpful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. Several homes in my community being repiped and have spoken with next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this. Apparently it starts with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can trigger major damage if the leak isn't spotted soon.</p>
