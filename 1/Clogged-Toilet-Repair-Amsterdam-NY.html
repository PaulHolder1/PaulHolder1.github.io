<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. Also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close.

When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately begins. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regrowth typically takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
