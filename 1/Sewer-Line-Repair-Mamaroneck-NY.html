<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
