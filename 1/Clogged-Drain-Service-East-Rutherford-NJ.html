<p>Inspect the washer for wear or fractures when you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve. Replacing a bad washer is cheap and easy. However finding the right washer might not be. The most typical washers are often available in your home centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be difficult to discover. If you decide to hunt for a washer, eliminate it and take it to the shop to discover a match. Plumbers generally replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
