<h3>Helpful Tips For Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Travelers Rest SC</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
