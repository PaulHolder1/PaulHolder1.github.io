<h3>Toilet Installation in Tallmadge Ohio</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least 3 efforts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his understanding and experience he figured out that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris decreased the recently cleaned up main drain.
