<p>Surprise water leaks are often difficult and have Potentially Major Repercussions. Changing your flapper may require slightly different steps than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job. To find an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Switch off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but opportunities are you'll find among the very same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
<p>Water softening describes the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- usually salt. The result is water that's been effectively softened by eliminating almost all traces of the minerals that make up hard water.</p>
