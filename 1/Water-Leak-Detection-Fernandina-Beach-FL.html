"Regrowing" refers to the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it becomes "exhausted" or complete. Nevertheless, numerous water softeners regenerate too often, when the filter medium truly isn't complete. This can be corrected by simply resetting your water softener to eliminate less firmness or to run longer between regeneration cycles.</p>
