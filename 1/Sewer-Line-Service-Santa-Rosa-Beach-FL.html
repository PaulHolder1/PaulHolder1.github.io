<p>As soon as, the gas pipe turns up from the ground (called the riser"), it can continue to be covered, however should then transition to galvanized. I am not exactly sure why that need to be.

<p>Both methods are extremely effective and lowering waste and clearing it. The biggest distinction is in timing. With a batch disposal, you fill the unit, cover it, then turn it on. If it's completely complete, it will take a little while to clear through the waste, and if you discover you forgot something, you need to wait till it's done to put the new waste in.</p>

This distinction in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water flows in the regular direction.</p>
