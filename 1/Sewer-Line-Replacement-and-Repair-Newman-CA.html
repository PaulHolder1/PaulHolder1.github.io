<p>Due to the fact that the copper pipes have actually not had a possibility to end up being coated within, New homes built with copper pipes are especially prone to corrosive water conditions. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new house for a period of 3 to five months after occupancy.
