<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the building; extra, more substantial costs can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for homeowners. A PE or RA can help identify if setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>
<p>A check backflow preventer includes 2 spring-loaded check assemblies to prevent back siphonage and back pressure on non-health hazard (low risk) systems. Loosen the coupling nut that connects the supply line. If the toilet valve turns inside the toilet tank, hold its base with a locking pliers. Tip: Throw a towel on the floor beneath to catch water that will drain from the line.</p>
