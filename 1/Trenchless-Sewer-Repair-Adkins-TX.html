<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to prevent backflow. The standard ways of preventing backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The basic system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
<p>A double check backflow preventer includes two spring-loaded check assemblies to avoid back siphonage and back pressure on non-health danger (low threat) systems.
