<p>Covert water leakages are typically difficult and have Possibly Serious Consequences. Changing your flapper might require a little different steps than we show (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Switch off the water prior to getting rid of the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, however chances are you'll find one of the same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
<p>A water softener works by using electrical charges to remove the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and numerous other minerals carry positive charges, so water softeners use sodium ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with potable water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, potable and watering, you are also required to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
