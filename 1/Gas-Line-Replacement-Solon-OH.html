It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air should be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will accumulate.</p>

<p>New houses built with copper pipes are especially susceptible to destructive water conditions due to the fact that the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to end up being covered inside. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a duration of 3 to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Lots of new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
