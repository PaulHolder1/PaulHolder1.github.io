<p>Water softening describes the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a process called ion exchange.

<p>If your pipes are close to or past their helpful life, it's time to think about replacing them entirely. Pipe life expectancies differ, but typically speaking, pipes 50 years or older need to be inspected. Materials frequently used during the 1970s, such as galvanized steel, might have worn away by now. It's also crucial to replace lead pipes as soon as possible since of their unfavorable health results as well as polybutylene pipes, which tend to leak.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends upon the extent of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

The camera can identify the problem and find so the drain can be repaired.</p>
<p>Whenever you flush your toilet, you'll see that water runs to refill the bowl. Nevertheless, in a correctly working toilet, the water should stop running once the bowl is filled to its proper capacity.
