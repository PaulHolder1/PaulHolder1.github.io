<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Generally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you've been advised by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
