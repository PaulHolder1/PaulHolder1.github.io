<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were widely used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and channels, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
