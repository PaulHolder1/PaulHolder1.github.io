<p>The cost connected with sewer line inspection may differ significantly based upon your situations. Property owners can usually expect a rate point in between $100 and $300, however obviously, this is simply a rough estimate.

You should also understand all the services that come with your sewer video inspection. The cost may include additional services, justifying a higher cost.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you might need to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug set that I purchased independently from the disposal unit. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>You live in an older home. There's an excellent possibility that you'll need to have it done quickly if your home is 50 years old or older and you've never ever replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to wear away and burst when they get old. If so, you might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one. This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
