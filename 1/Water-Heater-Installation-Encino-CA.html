<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral material.

Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.
