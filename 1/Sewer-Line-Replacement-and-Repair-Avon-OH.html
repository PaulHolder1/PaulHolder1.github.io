<p>Many toilet problems, including leaking toilets, don't demand repairing the whole toilet. Like any home device, a toilet tank features many little moving parts that might need changed with usage over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all break and trigger toilet leaks that aren't clearly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can likewise take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>To identify which toilet valve is triggering the problem, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overflowing into television, there's a problem with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, consistent outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing totally. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water discolorations and rust. But don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
