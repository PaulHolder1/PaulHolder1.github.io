<p>Drain pipe is not secured using the required solvent cement (end of the pipe need to be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not actually glued in the regular sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is in fact a solvent that melts the surfaces of the pipe and fitting for a few seconds. Broken Pipes: Pipes are broken, punctured or collapsed by shifting soil, frozen ground, settling, and so on</p>
<p>In most cases, an absence of hot water is triggered by a defective circuit breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. The dip tube inside the tank may be broken if the water is lukewarm. Scalding water is generally the result of a broken pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water threatens and should be immediately addressed by an experienced plumbing professional.</p>
