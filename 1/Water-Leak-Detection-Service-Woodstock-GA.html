<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
