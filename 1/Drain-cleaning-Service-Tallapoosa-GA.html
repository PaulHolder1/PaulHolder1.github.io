<p>Drain pipe is not secured utilizing the required solvent cement (end of the pipe need to be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not really glued in the routine sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is in fact a solvent that melts the surfaces of the pipe and fitting for a few seconds. Broken Pipes: Pipes are split, punctured or collapsed by moving soil, frozen ground, settling, and so on</p>
<p>Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline before the problem got worse. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive alternative.</p>
