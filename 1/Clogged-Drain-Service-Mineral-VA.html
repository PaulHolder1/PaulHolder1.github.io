However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does happen regularly than you think! When you don't see the water was off for a few minutes, often it happens at night. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a brand-new pipe. This makes building and construction jobs quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire combating is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
