Softening your water down to the ideal level of 6 grains of firmness is ideal for household use because the water stays less destructive than over-softened water and is without scale producing firmness. Considering that gas lines range from your home to the outdoor area of your residential or commercial property if there is a broken gas line beyond the home you will see damaged plant life and condensation on the windows closest to the damaged plumbing.</p>

When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
