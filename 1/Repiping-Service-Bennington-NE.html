Softening your water down to the ideal level of 6 grains of firmness is ideal for household use because the water stays less destructive than over-softened water and is without scale producing firmness. Considering that gas lines range from your home to the outdoor area of your residential or commercial property if there is a broken gas line beyond the home you will see damaged plant life and condensation on the windows closest to the damaged plumbing.</p>

This enables pressure to equalize between the Supply Side and the Zone of Minimized Pressure. When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
