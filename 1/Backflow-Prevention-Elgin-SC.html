<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is typical in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately working together that you can achieve this.</p>
