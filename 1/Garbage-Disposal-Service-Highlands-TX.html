<p>When the end user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water flows in the typical direction from the provider, downstream to fill the user's need. The flow of water pushes the spring-loaded check valves open. The tension of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure distinction in the Zone of Reduced Pressure. This distinction in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water flows in the regular instructions.</p>
