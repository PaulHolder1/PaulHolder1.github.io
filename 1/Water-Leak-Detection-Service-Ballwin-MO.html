<h3>Reverse Osmosis Installment in Ballwin Missouri</h2>
<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal flow direction within a piping system that is triggered by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of typical flow in a system caused by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water system piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is decreased main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are installed in areas where water could cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
