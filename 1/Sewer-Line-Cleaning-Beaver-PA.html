<p>You also need to buy a backflow valve if you observe your water has an unusual circulation, taste, smell or color. A plumbing professional can determine whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the outcome of other concerns in your home's plumbing system.

Hard water with calcium and magnesium streams through this resin and, in a process called ion exchange, the solidity ions in the water trade places with soft ions on the resin beads. The outcome is soft water.</p>
