<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and germs from becoming a problem in your water supply by sending out an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system. The signal triggers the minerals to join together, forming clusters that eventually form steady crystals. These crystals do not cling to surfaces like individual minerals would.</p>

<p>The Final Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that regulates water circulation in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't installed correctly, you may experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in lost water.</p>
