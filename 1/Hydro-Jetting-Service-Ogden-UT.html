<p>In this scenario, filthy water from the hillside pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Worms for watering systems: Homeowners found parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the air pressure breaker malfunctioned on an independently owned underground lawn sprinkler.

<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully created and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
