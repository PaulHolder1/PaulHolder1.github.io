<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services Longview TX</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leaks occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been discovered to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these issues.</p>
