Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is small, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this increase can present problems.</p>
