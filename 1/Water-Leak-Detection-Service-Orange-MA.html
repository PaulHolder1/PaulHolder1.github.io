An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a new pipe. This makes building and construction projects easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire engine use huge pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will happen in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
