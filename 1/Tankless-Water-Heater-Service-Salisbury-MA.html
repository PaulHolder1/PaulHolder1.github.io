<p>Domestic water that gets here to your Ohio home brings minerals that can trigger rust on metal parts and elements. To prevent corrosion from rust, storage tanks are equipped with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod safeguards the tank by attracting damaging products. By having the anode rod inspected regularly and replaced as needed, you can double the life of your water heater.</p>
<p>Even for a non-steel plumbing system, age will ultimately take its toll. If you discover that your plumbing experiences numerous clogs, leaks, and water pressure fluctuation that no amount of repairs appears to stem, you must consult a reliable plumber about whole-house repiping as a service. Property owners need to inspect water pressure entering their home on a routine basis. Water pressure need to have to do with 55 to 60 PSI; some city water pressure can be available in at over 100 PSI.</p>
