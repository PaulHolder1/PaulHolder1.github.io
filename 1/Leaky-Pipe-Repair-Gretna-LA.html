Tough water with calcium and magnesium flows through this resin and, in a process called ion exchange, the solidity ions in the water trade locations with soft ions on the resin beads. The result is soft water.</p>
<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water travels through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is typically utilized in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
