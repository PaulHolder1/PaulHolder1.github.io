<h3>Blocked Sewer in El Campo TX - Some Vital Info You Should Know</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers bring only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close.
