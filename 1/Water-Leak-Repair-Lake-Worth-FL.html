<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is common in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
