Dissolved minerals found in difficult water can clog drains, develop scale in pipes, and make your home appliances less efficient.

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
