After we have cleaned up the body, and the repaired elements are still out of the body, and we have finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or particles. This can be challenging, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is essential that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be utilized to assure the line is appropriately flushed.</p>
