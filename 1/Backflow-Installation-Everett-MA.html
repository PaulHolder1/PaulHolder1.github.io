An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or link a new pipe. This makes building tasks easily the most common cause of backflow problems.

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of house centers carry just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet.
