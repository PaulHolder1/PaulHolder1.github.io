<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system should be continuously kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
