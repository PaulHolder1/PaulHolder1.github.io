<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system needs to be continually monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
