A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and an individually acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. A PVB may be used to separate health or non-health dangers but is effective versus back-siphonage only.</p>
