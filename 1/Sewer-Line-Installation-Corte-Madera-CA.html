<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a complete repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
