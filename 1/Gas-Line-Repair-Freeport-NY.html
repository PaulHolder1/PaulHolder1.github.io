I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine.
