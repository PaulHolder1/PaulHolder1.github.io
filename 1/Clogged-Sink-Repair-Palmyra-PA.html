Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

<p>If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Houses that were built prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how helpful, is an ecological contaminant (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in homes that is not lead based). If you have children, you may not wish to live in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>If a clogged drain is left uncontrolled, it can quickly end up being a plumbing emergency for your home. At Polestar Plumbing, Heating & Cooling we provide 24-hour emergency support for situations like burst pipes brought on by blockages. Detach the garbage disposal, if you're waiting. How the disposal is connected to the sink varies based on brand name and type. Describe your product instructions or contact the maker if you need guidance. The disposal will usually be connected to the drain line with either a nut or a screw.</p>
