Often the type and installation requirements are spelled out by local statutes and environmental guidelines. Local building regulations for instance will require a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air gap between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any prospective siphon before it can happen, preventing infecting water from being drawn back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more advanced and complicated backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices installed to prevent backflow variety from the relatively easy to the complicated and extremely sophisticated.</p>
