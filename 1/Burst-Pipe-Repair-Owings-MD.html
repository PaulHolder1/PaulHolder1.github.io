Galvanized pipes were most often installed in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are understood to burst and corrode when they get old. You may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
