<p>The average life span of an electrical water heater is more than that of a gas one. Hidden sets of pipes use pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a separate drain pathway, little pipes run from the tub and sink to ultimately meet a larger one beneath the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and eventually out of the house.</p>

<p>To determine which toilet valve is causing the difficulty, take a look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to drip into the bowl. That slow, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing entirely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water stains and rust. But do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
