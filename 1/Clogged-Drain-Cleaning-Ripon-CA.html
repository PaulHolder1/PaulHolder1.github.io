<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back against the required direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water.

The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for efficiency, along with inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
