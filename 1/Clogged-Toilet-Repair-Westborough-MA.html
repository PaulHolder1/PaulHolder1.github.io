Typically, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet this increase can present problems.</p>
