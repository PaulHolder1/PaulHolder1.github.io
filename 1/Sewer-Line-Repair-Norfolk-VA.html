<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really quickly.

<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>When deciding on the correct system protection there are a number of considerations we need to look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world.

An airplane garage will need an extremely various fire protection system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow defense requirements for these two examples would likewise vary considerably.</p>
