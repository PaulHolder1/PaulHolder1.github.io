<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the first most apparent indications of a sewer concern is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple issue such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a larger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent severe damage to your house. Even if the issue comes from with the community system, it's still smart to generate the professionals to restrict the damage to your house.</p>
<p>Sometimes you know you have a sewer line break because you can smell nasty odors or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is important to pinpoint the specific place of the break in your sewer line. Many times the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can save you thousands of dollars in repairs. Simply sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can resolve the problem. The professionals and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you always have a copy for your insurance company, city or realtor inspector.</p>
