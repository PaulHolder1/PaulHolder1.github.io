<p>An RPBA is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two independently acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and listed below the first check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. An RPBA works versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and may be used to isolate health or non-health threats.</p>
<p>Water softeners, like the CareSoft Pro, work by removing an abundance of calcium and magnesium from water. Sediment from these components not only dry out your skin and hair but also develop in home appliances and pipes reducing their efficiency and life expectancy.

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system needs to be constantly kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
