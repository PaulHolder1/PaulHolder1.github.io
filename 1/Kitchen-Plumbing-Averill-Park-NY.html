<p>The majority of houses or structures that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather protection. As the external finishing of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
