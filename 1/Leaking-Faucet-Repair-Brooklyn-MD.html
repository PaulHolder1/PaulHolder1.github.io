This can be difficult, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is very important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system has to be made use of to guarantee the line is correctly flushed.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a serious public health risk if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies set up.
