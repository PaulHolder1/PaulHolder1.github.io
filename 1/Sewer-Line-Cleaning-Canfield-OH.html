However, the high-energy cost savings will more than recover this expense over the next couple of years. To get your waste disposal unit working again, you will first want to utilize a flashlight to look for foreign items lodged in the drum's openings. You can remove it safely with needle-nose pliers if you observe a blockage.</p>
<p>Leaks can take place if the seal between the tank and bowl fails, or the seal at the floor drain fails.
