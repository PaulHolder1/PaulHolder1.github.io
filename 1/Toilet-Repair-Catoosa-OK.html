Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leaks take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these problems.</p>
