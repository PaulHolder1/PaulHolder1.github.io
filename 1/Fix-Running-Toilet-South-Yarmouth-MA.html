<p>Water isn't hot enough. Since you may put up with it for weeks or even months prior to deciding it requires to be fixed, this can be frustrating. Luckily it's typically a quick, easy fix. We see this a lot on standard electrical water heaters, which use a pair of electrical heating elements to heat the tank. Frequently, one of the 2 burns out, resulting in water that's not hot but warm. If this isn't it, we can replace it or detect the real problem.</p>
<p>Other pipe repair strategies include our Pipe Pull method and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull strategy interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into location. All new replacement pipes have a projected life-span of one hundred years and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another effective strategy is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically eliminates the need for broken pipe removal. By inserting a hardening lining material which coats the within the existing pipe, a brand-new pipe is developed inside the broken one.</p>
