<h3>Water Heaters & Water Filtering in Wakefield Rhode Island</h2>

<p>The Final Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that manages water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't installed correctly, you might experience a frequently or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in wasted water.</p>
