Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
