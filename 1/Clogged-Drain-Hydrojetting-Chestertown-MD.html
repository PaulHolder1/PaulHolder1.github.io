<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not recede against the required direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can become infected. There is capacity for the contaminated water to become a health risk if permitted to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for efficiency, along with inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
