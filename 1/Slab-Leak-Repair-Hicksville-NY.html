The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system.

If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is more than likely originating from the inside of your hot water heater. Replace your hot water heater as soon as possible if this holds true.
