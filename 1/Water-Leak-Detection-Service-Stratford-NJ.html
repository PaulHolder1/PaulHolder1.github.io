<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is typical in our industry and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market.
