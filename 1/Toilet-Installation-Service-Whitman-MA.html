<h3>Fix a Leaky Outside Frost Free Faucet in Whitman MA</h3>
<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets must absolutely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. If you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it, that toilet needs to be changed. Improperly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural integrity of the home.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers carry only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
