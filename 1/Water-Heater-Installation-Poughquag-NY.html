<p>SofTap's water softening technology is well-suited for household, commercial, and commercial applications, consisting of the prevention of limescale accumulation in homes and scaling in industrial water treatment systems, as well as enhancing existing reverse osmosis treatment systems. The innovation is simpler and more economical than other softening systems on the marketplace today that use zeolites, which need to be restored utilizing brine, or membrane nanofiltration that requires significant water usage and high pressure.</p>

The primary types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
