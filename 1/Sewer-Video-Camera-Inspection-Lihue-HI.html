<p>Badly set up gas lines result in gas leakages. Gas leakages are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy job. The gas lines need to be adjusted to the ideal levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy states that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the second highest energy consuming area of a house, beside heating & cooling. The amount of minerals dissolved in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>
<p>Find out if there are any lead pipes in the home. Houses that were built prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based). You may not want to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
