<p>A lot of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather defense. As the external finishing of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>

After softening a big amount of hard water, the exchange medium ends up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions. The exchange medium must be recharged or regrowed (Figure 1)when this happens.
