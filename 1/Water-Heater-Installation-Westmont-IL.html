<p>Tankless hot water heater are often called on-demand hot water heater. These water heating systems produce warm water as it is needed by heating the water that flows from your water main to your tap, bypassing the need for a tank. A tankless water heater frequently costs less to run over its lifetime, but generally costs more upfront than tank hot water heater. Depending upon your requirements, you may need more than one tankless water heater to fulfill your day-to-day warm water needs.</p>
<p>Conventional tank-type water heaters consist of steel cylinders that are fed by a water pipe that dips into a big tank. The water inside this tank is warmed up and then released into the pipes of your home through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank consists of the temperature level and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you exceed a preset level. You'll also find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control system outside for setting temperatures and managing the pilot-light valve.</p>
