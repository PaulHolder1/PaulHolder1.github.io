<p>DCVs are specifically developed to avoid backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The mainstay for normal fire security applications, DCVs include an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, 2 independently running spring-loaded check valves (usually inside a single valve body), 4 test cocks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve. Light-duty commercial-grade garbage disposals start around $500-$ 2,500 and increase depending on size, brand name and features.</p>
