<p>To identify which toilet valve is triggering the difficulty, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overflowing into the tube, there's an issue with the toilet fill valve.

That sluggish, consistent outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing completely. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water spots and rust.
