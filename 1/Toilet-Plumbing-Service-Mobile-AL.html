<p>Because the copper pipes have actually not had an opportunity to end up being covered inside, New houses built with copper pipes are specifically prone to corrosive water conditions. As recommended by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new home for a duration of three to five months after occupancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Many brand-new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>

Backflow into a public water system can pollute or infect the water in that system (i.e., backflow into a public water system can make the water in that system hazardous or unusable to consume), and each water provider has a responsibility to supply water that is usable and safe to drink under all foreseeable circumstances. In addition, consumers typically have outright faith that water delivered to them through a public water system is always safe to drink. For these reasons, your water district must take preventative measures to protect its public water supply versus backflow.</p>

Some designs may seem similar on the outdoors however could need various repair parts on the inside, so the repair technician need to be able to recognize the make, design and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that may have been produced. Sometimes the serial number of the assembly will be needed to distinguish one design from another. It is essential to know the correct design to guarantee you get the correct repair parts.</p>
