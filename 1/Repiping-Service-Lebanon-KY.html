Throughout regrowth, salty water from the salt water tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>Having your plumbing repiped can conserve you money and time as well as secure your health in the future. After softening a big amount of tough water, the exchange medium ends up being coated with calcium and magnesium ions. The exchange medium must be recharged or regenerated (Figure 1)when this takes place.
