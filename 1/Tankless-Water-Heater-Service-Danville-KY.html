<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual choice. A license is not needed for repairs which involve just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions offered alterations are not made in the existing piping or components. A typical water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, large salt water tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line.

When tough water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills with firmness ions, it needs to be restored (cleaned up). Salt is normally utilized in the regeneration procedure and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
