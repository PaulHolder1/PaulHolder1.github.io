Nevertheless, they can stand up to high water temperature levels so they are great to use in hot water lines.</p>
<p>The normal service is to have the defective pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older house - such as one developed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately suffers from rust and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
