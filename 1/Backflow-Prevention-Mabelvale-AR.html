<p>In some cases you know you have a sewer line break due to the fact that you can smell nasty smells or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is important to identify the precise area of the break in your sewer line. Oftentimes the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and understanding this can conserve you thousands of dollars in repairs. Merely sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can resolve the issue. The professionals and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you constantly have a copy for your insurance coverage company, real estate agent or city inspector.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this method, you understand the turnkey cost entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
