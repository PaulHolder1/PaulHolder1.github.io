<p>Sometimes you know you have a sewer line break due to the fact that you can smell nasty odors or you have a sewage back-up in your house. It is very important to pinpoint the specific area of the break in your sewer line. Oftentimes the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can conserve you thousands of dollars in repairs. Simply sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can solve the issue. The professionals and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you always have a copy for your insurance company, city or realtor inspector.</p>
<p>How much is a sewer line inspection? These specialized assessments consist of specialized camera devices that runs into your sewer line. A camera inspection is much more palatable than trenching through the yard if you have actually identified pooling water in the lawn. This will cost you (on average) between $300-$ 400. Master plumber licenses are awarded to plumbers who have held a journey license for a particular amount of time, and have accumulated the required hours working as a licensed journey plumber. In addition, a master plumber also has to pass a state sanctioned test.</p>
