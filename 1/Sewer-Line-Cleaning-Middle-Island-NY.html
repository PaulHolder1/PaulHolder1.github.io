<h3>How to Keep A Clogged Toilet From Becoming A Disaster in Middle Island NY</h3>
<p>Do you need Leesburg VA sink repairs? Kiddco Plumbing can help! Repairing, replacing or setting up a new sink is among those jobs that's a little harder to get done right than it appears. What appears like an easy task frequently becomes a weekend long trouble trying to fit the new sink into the opening, line up the water supply lines and drain pipes, install the faucets and other fixtures, and put the whole thing together so that the brand-new sink is strongly secured in place, all the plumbing fits and work correctly and none of the water supply lines or drains leak.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>2. DO throw a few lemon or orange peels into your disposal from time to time to help it function properly - and to make your kitchen odor fresh and clean.
