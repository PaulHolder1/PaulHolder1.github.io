No, it is not a regular event, but it does happen more often than you believe! Often it takes place during the night when you do not discover the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a brand-new pipe. This makes construction tasks quickly the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding communities.</p>

Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up requiring to be effectively re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
