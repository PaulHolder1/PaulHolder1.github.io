<h3>Shower Repairs in Lambertville NJ - The Processes Involved</h3>
<p>Plumbing contractors are trained not just in plumbing however also in construction and service and can deal with a lot more requests than plumbers.

Call us for commercial plumbing services in Tuscaloosa, AL Garbage disposals help your kitchen run smoothly but are vulnerable to problems. If yours is breaking down and is near the end of its life expectancy, which normally lasts 5 to ten years, it might make more sense to replace it than repair it.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers bring only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
