Considering that a hot water heater is a point of lots of leaks in the home, this will give you assurance and guarantee that your family has a constant supply of warm water. If the water heater has a drain valve, we'll drain and flush it to keep it operating at peak efficiency. Draining a water heater extend its life.</p>
<p>Conventional tank-type water heaters include steel cylinders that are fed by a pipes that dips into a big tank. The water inside this tank is warmed up and after that released into the pipes of your house through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank.

You'll also find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control system outside for setting temperatures and controlling the pilot-light valve.</p>
