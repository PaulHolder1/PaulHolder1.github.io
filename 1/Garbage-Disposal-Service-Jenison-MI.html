For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, because whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water originating from your water devices? This is a good sign that your pipes may be rusting from the inside and therefore, need to be changed. Keep in mind that if the rust-colored water just comes with warm water, the cause might be a rusted out hot water heater-- not your home's piping.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood further away from the flange. Before you install this type of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace an area of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

That sluggish, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing entirely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water discolorations and corrosion.
