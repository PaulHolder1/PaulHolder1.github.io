<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Morristown NJ</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
