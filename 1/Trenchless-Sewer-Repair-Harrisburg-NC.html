<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. There is capacity for the contaminated water to become a health hazard if permitted to return to the water supply.
