You might not find an identical match, however chances are you'll locate among the exact same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>

See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Many new houses are built with PEX and not copper.</p>

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is usually the culprit. But not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with too little slack can cause problem too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
