<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They instantly cleared the initial blockage, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further examination, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
