Commercial supply of water normally has a minimum standard of quality, depending upon the industrial process in question. Farming on the other hand has less rigid water quality requirements. But where backflow preventers are most important remains in the supply of drinkable water for personal and domestic use.</p>
<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of significant surgery, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and figure out the cause of the issue. The line was clearly weakening; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
