<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Moore SC</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leaks take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has actually been found to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
