If it takes you two days to re-plumb a house with copper, you can do that very same home in a day with PEX," says Emanuel.</p>
<p>Because of the inherent style of a decreased pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on an incredibly low circulation or fixed circulation condition might cause annoyance leaking and potential fouling of the assembly. While not effective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure consistent to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
