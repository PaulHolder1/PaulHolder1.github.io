<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Services in Eastchester</h2>

One common method for a home's supply of water to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which might end up being polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the problem could spread out exponentially. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in specific residences, it also prevents wastewater in personal homes from flowing back out and polluting the public water system.</p>

Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the unit to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be used. Though it may require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
