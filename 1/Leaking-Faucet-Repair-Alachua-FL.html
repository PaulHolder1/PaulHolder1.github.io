For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that speed up deterioration Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective form of corrosion control. Hence, considering all these aspects, along with results from research studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
