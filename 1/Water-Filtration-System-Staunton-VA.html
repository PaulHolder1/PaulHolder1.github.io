<p>Throughout normal operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of reduced pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is developed to discharge and open water to the exterior. An RPZ will occasionally discharge percentages of water due to change in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ should be set up in areas that are not subject to water damage and enable sufficient drainage.</p>
