<p>Water softeners leaks are primarily triggered because of a problem at the point of installation or because of maintenance. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. If the bypass valve is broken, it can also trigger the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced over time. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regrowth processes. A used water valve can lock up and spring a leak. It is most likely broken and just needs to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
