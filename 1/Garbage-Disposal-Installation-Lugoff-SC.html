<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of significant surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle often. When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have actually never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing frequent and significant leaks, you might be in need of water line repiping. We find that repiping can in fact be the cheaper and better long-term solution if you do have frequent leakages.</p>

When searching for plumbing services in the area, be specific with your needs and ask prospects if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the advanced experience and licenses associated with a plumbing contractor.</p>
