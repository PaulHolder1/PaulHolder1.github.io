<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Glen Saint Mary FL</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause countless dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel way off schedule. So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers deal with all types of work. Their tasks break out into two classifications: Plumbers who deal with fundamental repairs (often in emergency situations), and plumbers who specialize in redesigning additions and tasks.</p>
<p>Pipefitters, plumbers, and steamfitters finish an apprenticeship program and pass the needed licensing examination to become journey-level workers. Journey-level plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters are qualified to carry out jobs separately. Plumbers with a number of years of plumbing experience who pass another test earn master status. Some states need master plumber status in order to acquire a plumbing contractor's license.</p>
