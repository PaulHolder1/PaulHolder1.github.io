He got our drain cleared out in a very effective and professional  manner. I would not think twice to call Roto-Rooter for any future requirements. Toilet Runs Periodically - Don't you hate it when the toilet runs 5 minutes after you flushed? It usually suggests there is a concern with the flapper, or the toilet is leaking water someplace.</p>
<p>To determine which toilet valve is triggering the trouble, take a look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overflowing into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to trickle into the bowl. That slow, constant outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing entirely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water spots and deterioration. But don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
