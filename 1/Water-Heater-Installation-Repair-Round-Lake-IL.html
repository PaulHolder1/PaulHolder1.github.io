<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains significant amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite an annoyance-- for its many intended usages around your house.</p>
<p>Water firmness is the quantity of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the distinction on your skin is since soap reacts with the calcium to form soap scum. This results in the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. And that's where the term solidity" came from ... it's difficult to clean in.</p>
