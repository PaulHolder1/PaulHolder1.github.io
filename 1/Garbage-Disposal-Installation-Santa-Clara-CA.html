<p>A waste disposal unit should not leak. When this happens, it generally indicates wear and tear which is a reasonable indication that its time is up. Leaks can be unhygienic and will also ultimately cause stress on other parts of your garbage disposal if you think about what you put down the disposal. The kitchen sink drain might need a simple tightening up or a replacement. If the leak is in the pressurized hose spray, you will see the obvious spray. For a leak in the drain pipe, you may need to fill the sink with water prior to examining the pipe beneath.</p>
<p>Softeners mainly eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently described as 'firmness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they need to be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a substantial red flag that something more major is incorrect with them.</p>
