<p>The Bureau of Plumbing and Gasfitting Inspections is a department of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections and is responsible for examining work carried out by licensed plumbers and gasfitters to ensure conformity with the plumbing and gas code. Costs 41-15 (PDF): The Present Plumbing and Gasfitting Code of Baltimore County was authorized by the County Council on May 4, 2015 with a reliable date of July 1, 2015.

<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
