<p>Aside from water dripping and the periodic creak, your pipes should not be making any odd noises, especially not ones loud enough to keep you up during the night. If your pipes are rattling, clanking, banging or making other obnoxious sounds, that's a proven sign of a larger problem. Have your pipes checked as quickly as possible so you don't end up with a significant leak.</p>

<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the building; extra, more considerable expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for citizens. A PE or RA can help determine if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>

Your hot water heater should be flushed once a year. It might have up to 8 inches of sediment at the bottom of the tank if you have a 15‐year‐old water heater that's never been flushed. That suggests eight less inches of warm water, not to mention the reality that your tap water is being warmed in a tank with calcium, scale, rust, dirt, iron, and sulfuric‐smelling bacteria.</p>
