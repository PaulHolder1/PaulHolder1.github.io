You can order, with totally free shipping, a leading name-brand filtration or softener system by shopping at Any installation services below can then assist with installation, or you can simply install the system yourself.</p>
<p>When the end user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water streams in the normal direction from the provider, downstream to fill the user's need.

This distinction in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water flows in the typical direction.</p>
