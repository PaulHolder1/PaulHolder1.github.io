Water is no longer being pressed forward into your house and will flow backwards into the city water lines because pressure is lost throughout these events. Although an EcoWater dealer does not support your area currently, we more than happy to assist you with an alternative solution. You can order, with totally free shipping, a top name-brand filtration or softener system by shopping at Any installation services listed below can then help with installation, or you can just install the system yourself.</p>
<p>Most softeners have a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to provide some sort of maintenance to it or even while you're dealing with installing it. If the softener you pick does not have a bypass, then it's a good idea to build one out of plumbing to bypass the equipment in case you need to keep the unit.</p>
<p>It may be time to get it changed if your water heater has actually required several repairs over the last few years.

It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
