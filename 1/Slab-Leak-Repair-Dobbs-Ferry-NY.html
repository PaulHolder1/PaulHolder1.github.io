<p>We specialize in tub and shower replacement and full bathroom renovating at really competitive pricing.

While water overuse is a concern for your wallet, it's also a problem for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regrowth procedure. That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>We had an excellent experience with Joe Boyette, he was extremely professional, courteous, skilled. We had a lot of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month period. We also had to replace a bathroom and a water heater unassociated to the fire, but we felt confident in Joe's abilities. We made the decision to stick with Joe, even though we felt Mr Rooter rates were definitely on the high-end. This being posted by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>

<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>Transforming from electrical to gas or lp, or including home appliances will always require brand-new pipes. Your final expenses depend upon if you have existing gas lines in place or need new gas lines set up from the gas supply to the house. If you're performing repairs to your toilet or need to eliminate the tank from the bowl for any reason, it's constantly a good idea to change your gaskets and bolts (particularly if you have not in a while) to make certain whatever is still leak-proof. It's a economical and easy  way to assist keep things in great working order.</p>
<p>New houses developed with copper pipes are especially susceptible to corrosive water conditions due to the fact that the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to become coated within. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a period of three to five months after tenancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Many new houses are built with PEX and not copper.</p>
