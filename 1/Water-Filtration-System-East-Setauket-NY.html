<p>For example, backflow can happen when there's a break in the main water line or when a fire hydrant is opened for use.

<p>As discussed previously in the post, carbon monoxide gas is totally odor free and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every house ought to have carbon monoxide detectors installed at the appropriate places. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family houses to have both smoke and carbon monoxide gas detectors. They are typically sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new setups must have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the structure; extra, more significant costs can take place if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for locals. A PE or RA can help figure out if installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>
