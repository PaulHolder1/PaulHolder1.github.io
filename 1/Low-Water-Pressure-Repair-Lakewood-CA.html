Copper has actually been the favored choice to replace galvanized iron pipes (which utilized to be thought about really strong, but they were discovered to crack under pressure and tend to wear away within a couple of years).

These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to weaken in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This indicates the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
