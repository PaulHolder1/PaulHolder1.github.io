I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a significant clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
