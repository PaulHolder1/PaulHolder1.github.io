<p>Wood pipes were used in London and elsewhere during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were extensively used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and avenues, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
<p>Repiping is not a short-lived fix. It's a permanent option for the whole plumbing system in your home or company. We switch off the water supply, get rid of old pipe and replace it with new pipe. After the brand-new system is installed, we turn the water on and carry out tests on the new system. When the system passes our tests, it's excellent to go for you.</p>
