<p>Water softener systems work by removing hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to prevent the scale from developing by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener alternative in locations where it is prohibited to use salt. Water conditioners do not successfully eliminate solidity from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that regulates water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters your toilet.
