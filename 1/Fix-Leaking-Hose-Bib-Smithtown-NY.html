Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly used in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and channels, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
