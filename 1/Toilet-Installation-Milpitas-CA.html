The function of a repair on a backflow preventer is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. When the data shows the backflow prevention assembly is in need of repair, the need for a repair can only be determined by conducting a field test on the assembly and knowing.</p>
<p>The most convenient method to keep you and your family safe from the possible threats of backflow through cross connections is to not create cross connections in the very first location. Nevertheless, if you do have a cross connection to a lawn sprinkler system, boiler, swimming pool, water feature or other type of cross connection, have an approved backflow prevention assembly installed.</p>
