<h3>Do You Need Water Heater Repair in Plantsville CT?</h3>
<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are lots of aspects that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and property plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that accelerate corrosion Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of corrosion control. Hence, thinking about all these factors, in addition to results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
