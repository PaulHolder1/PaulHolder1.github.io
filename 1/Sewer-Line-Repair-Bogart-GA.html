<p>When the data gathered from the field test suggests the assembly has degraded in its efficiency listed below the developed minimum basic, backflow preventers should just be repaired. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if required, replaced.
