<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
