<p>Visible smell. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the backyard, basement, or throughout your home or company location, give us a call. That odor may be coming from your sewer system, which needs repair immediately. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that gets rid of sewage from your home, launches sewer gas, and manages atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually stopped working, it will often need to be changed rather than repaired.

In some cases the serial number of the assembly will be needed to separate one model from another. It is important to know the right design to ensure you get the proper repair parts.</p>
