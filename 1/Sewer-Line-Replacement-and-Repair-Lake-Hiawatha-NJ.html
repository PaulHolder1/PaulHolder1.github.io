<p>Converting from electric to gas or gas, or adding home appliances will always require new pipes. Your last expenses depend upon if you have existing gas lines in place or need new gas lines installed from the gas supply to your house. If you're carrying out repairs to your toilet or need to get rid of the tank from the bowl for any reason, it's always a great idea to change your bolts and gaskets (particularly if you have not in a while) to ensure everything is still leak-proof.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the extent of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll need to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
