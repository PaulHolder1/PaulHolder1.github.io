Many houses in the United States, including Tampa Bay Area, have what is referred to as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets likewise have a flapper seal made of rubber at the bottom of the cistern that keeps the water in the tank until the toilet is flushed.  This seal weakens gradually enabling water to leave into the toilet bowl, thus minimizing the quantity of water in the tank offered for a flush.

See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of brand-new homes are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
