Some models may appear comparable on the outside but might require different repair parts on the inside, so the repair service technician should be able to identify the make, model and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that may have been produced.

After they provided me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, because I never wish to see this company again.</p>
