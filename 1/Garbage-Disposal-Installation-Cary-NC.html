<p>Beneath the sink, stack the fiber gasket, backup flange, and installing ring, and slide onto the underside of the flange. Install the breeze ring by pulling it open and snapping into place. Heating water accounts for up to 20 percent of the typical home's energy spending plan. Some gas-fired tankless water heaters claim to cut energy costs by as much as half. But their included up-front costs imply it pays to look before you leap.</p>
<p>Improperly installed gas lines lead to gas leakages. Gas leakages are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy job.

It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a home, next to heating & cooling. The amount of minerals liquified in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and figure out the reason for the problem. The line was plainly weakening; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
