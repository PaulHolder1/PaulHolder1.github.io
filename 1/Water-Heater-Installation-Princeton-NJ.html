The CARIX ® ion exchange process (CArbon Dioxide Regenerated Ion EXchanger) enables a purposeful partial desalination and therefore softening of drinking water containing high quantities of hardeners, nitrate and sulfate.</p>
<p>Inadequately set up gas lines result in gas leakages. Gas leakages are costly to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself project. The gas lines have to be calibrated to the right levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy says that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a house, next to heating and cooling. The quantity of minerals liquified in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>
<p>Repiping is not a momentary fix. It's a permanent solution for the entire plumbing system in your house or organisation. We switch off the supply of water, get rid of old pipe and replace it with new pipe. After the brand-new system is installed, we turn the water on and carry out tests on the brand-new system. As soon as the system passes our tests, it's good to choose you.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the perpetrator. However not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can cause difficulty too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
