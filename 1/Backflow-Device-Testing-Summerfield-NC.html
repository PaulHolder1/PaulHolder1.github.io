<p>To identify which toilet valve is causing the problem, take a look at the overflow tube. There's an issue with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, constant outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing totally. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so beautiful inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water spots and corrosion. However do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
