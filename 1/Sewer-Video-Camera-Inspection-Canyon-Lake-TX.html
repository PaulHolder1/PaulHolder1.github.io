<p>Our Water Softeners Are Brilliantly Created To Work. Two great benefits of having a disposal unit set up are: 1) that it makes clean up around the kitchen easier, and 2) it considerably minimizes the amount of natural waste that you need to deal with.

If you have two meters, drinkable and irrigation, you are also required to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
