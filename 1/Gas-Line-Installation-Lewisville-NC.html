<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather condition protection. As the outer finish of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and avoid it from working. This is known as fouling. Sometimes it might be necessary to filter the water before it gets to your softener to avoid fouling. Commercial cleaners are available if the resin ends up being fouled. Cleaners need to be utilized according to manufacturer instructions to prevent contamination.</p>
