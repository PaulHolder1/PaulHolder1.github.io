<p>Very frequently the circular blade inside is stuck. DO NOT REACH INSIDE TO FREE IT! Just insert a long, sturdy, wood deal with (a broom manage will be enough) into the opening. Let it rest against the inside wall, and with force pushing down, turn clockwise till you feel it turn freely. It might be required to reset the disposal. If so, locate the reset switch on the bottom of the system. Utilize any type of drain cleaner to free it if the clog continues.</p>
