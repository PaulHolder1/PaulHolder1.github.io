<p>Will not drain - The system might not be slicing food correctly and waste may have clogged the drain pipe. However, if there are a number of leakages within the system, or if there is proof of corrosion in several places, it is probably time to repipe. A water softener is packed with resin beads. Tough water with calcium and magnesium streams through this resin and, in a process called ion exchange, the hardness ions in the water trade places with soft ions on the resin beads. The outcome is soft water.</p>
<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it contains. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so just softened water goes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it needs to be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is typically used in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
