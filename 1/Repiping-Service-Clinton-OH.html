As building types and contents of these buildings can be extremely different, we need to comprehend that the fire defense system for any installation needs to be developed and set up to satisfy that particular hazard or need. An aircraft hangar will need a very different fire defense system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow security requirements for these 2 examples would likewise differ significantly.</p>
