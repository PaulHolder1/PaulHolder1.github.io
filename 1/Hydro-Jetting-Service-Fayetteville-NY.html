<p>Procedure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are utilizing copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized.
