Unlike a drip leg, the circulation of the gas is altered to eliminate any sediment. A sediment trap might be consisted of in a drip leg install. The City requires backflow prevention devices to be set up anywhere there exists a connection that could permit tainted water into the City system or private plumbing. These devices are subject to testing by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In a lot of cases, they go through regular tests later on, as well.</p>

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to inspect the line and identify the reason for the issue. The line was clearly weakening; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
