<p>When you see a diagram of the working parts, Toilet repair can look stealthily simple. You think, Sure, I can do that," however read the directions carefully. For example, the basic instructions for toilet tank flush valve replacement consist of, Take care of completely scratching the flush valve seat", turned off main valve", disconnect hose pipes", and take care not to split the toilet tank." Even if you make it this far, the only thing you can do if your new tank flush valve does not work is check for leakages" and make changes." Suddenly, a fifty-minute task becomes an indefinitely unsettled concern.</p>
