<p>To figure out which toilet valve is triggering the difficulty, look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to drip into the bowl. That slow, consistent outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing completely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water spots and rust. However do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>

The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential double check valve.</p>
