<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
