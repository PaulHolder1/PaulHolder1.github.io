<p>Climatic vacuum breakers (AVB) are the most basic design of backflow preventer. If you have less than six control valves, they are the least expensive, but likewise the least reliable option. These devices are not developed as a whole-system backflow prevention valve; one should be installed at every control valve.

Before going into how to repair a toilet, it would benefit to understand how a toilet works.  Many houses in the US, consisting of Tampa Bay Area, have what is referred to as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets also have a flapper seal made of rubber at the bottom of the cistern that keeps the water in the tank up until the toilet is flushed.

However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill. This responsive style enables the MTS to use up to 50% less salt and 38% less regeneration water than standard single-tank or twin alternating systems.</p>
