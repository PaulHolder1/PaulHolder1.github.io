<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and identify the cause of the problem. The line was clearly weakening; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
