<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't draw in anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank can be found in. An on-board computer computes the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth instantly starts. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regeneration typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
