<p>Noticeable odor. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like odor) in the yard, basement, or anywhere in your house or business location, provide us a call. That odor may be coming from your sewer system, which requires repair right away. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that gets rid of sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and controls atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually failed, it will frequently need to be replaced rather than fixed. You'll know this if your pipes are gurgling or discharging nasty odors.</p>
