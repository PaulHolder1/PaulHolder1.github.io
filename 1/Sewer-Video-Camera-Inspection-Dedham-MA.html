<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a considerable obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
