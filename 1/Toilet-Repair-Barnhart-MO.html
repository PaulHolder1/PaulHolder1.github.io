Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material.

More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions.

<p>Improvement plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
