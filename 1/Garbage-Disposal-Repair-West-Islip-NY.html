<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from typical circulation instructions within a piping system that is brought on by unfavorable pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of regular circulation in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the water supply piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

Running water: If the toilet runs even when it hasn't been just recently utilized and you have actually changed the flapper, the problem may be larger than it appears. The tank eventually loses its ability to seal correctly, creating waste and a higher water costs.</p>
