<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
