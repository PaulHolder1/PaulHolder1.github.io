<p>Backflow is dangerous due to the fact that it can contaminate the public drinking supply with contaminants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and harmful chemicals.

<p>When the end user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water flows in the regular instructions from the provider, downstream to fill the user's need. The flow of water pushes the spring-loaded check valves open. The tension of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure difference in the Zone of Lowered Pressure. This difference in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water streams in the regular instructions.</p>

This can force the potable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Potential contaminants can then get in the safe and clean water system. The very best method to reduce accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of when a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is specifically difficult with high mineral content, you may need to flush the hot water heater more frequently.</p>
