<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had actually backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least 3 attempts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his understanding and experience he figured out that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear however the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris decreased the freshly cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and persistence the job was done to my complete satisfaction.</p>
