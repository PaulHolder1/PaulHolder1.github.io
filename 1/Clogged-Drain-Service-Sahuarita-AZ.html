<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has actually typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due mainly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to customer misconceptions about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening just gets rid of hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are an annoyance and not a danger to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
<p>In general, toilets are pretty basic to run and repair.
