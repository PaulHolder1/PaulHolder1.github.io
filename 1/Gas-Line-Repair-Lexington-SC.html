Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it might require additional adapters, versatile tubing is far much easier to work with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>

<p>If your hot water heater has required several repairs over the last few years, it may be time to get it changed. A good general rule for water heaters is this: since the life expectancy of the average hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. If the cost of a repair is over half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your hot water heater.</p>
<p>Call a plumber: If the clog is not in the P-trap and water streams freely from the sink drain into your bucket, then it's time to call a plumber The clog is likely even more down the line. Leaking sewer lines inside your house can harm floorings, carpentry, and other important items such as cabinets. Left ignored, leaking sewer water can result in mold and a lot more serious structural damage. If neglected, leaking sewer water from your main home drain or house sewer can also cause comprehensive damage.</p>
