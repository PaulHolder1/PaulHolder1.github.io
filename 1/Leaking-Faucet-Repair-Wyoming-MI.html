However, damage such as deep cracks might require a sink replacement.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is normal in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can attain this.</p>
