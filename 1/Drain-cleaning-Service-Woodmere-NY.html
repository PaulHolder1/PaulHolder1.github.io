<p>Waste disposal unit are an important feature in any modern kitchen. If you live in an older house, your sink might not have one, forcing you to be diligent about keeping food scraps from flowing down the drain. It's also possible for a disposal to all of a sudden break, bringing cooking or cleanup to a grinding stop. Copper pipes = $1.50-$ 2.00 per direct foot. Copper pipes are eco-friendly and are resistant to breaking. However, they're also the most costly in this list and in locations with tough water (like Florida) they can develop pinhole leaks.</p>

Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free.
