<p>Obvious smell. The minute you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like odor) in the yard, basement, or anywhere in your house or business location, offer us a call. That smell might be originating from your sewer system, which needs repair right away. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your house, launches sewer gas, and controls air pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually failed, it will often need to be replaced rather than repaired. You'll know this if your pipes are gurgling or producing foul odors.</p>

This detailed inspection can uncover serious problems with your sewer line you might not observe up until it's too late.
