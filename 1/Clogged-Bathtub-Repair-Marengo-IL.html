<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from normal circulation direction within a piping system that is caused by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the reversal of normal flow in a system brought on by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can happen when there is a high velocity in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as throughout fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>The best way to avoid clogged drains is to use an enzyme drain cleaner as preventive maintenance. Enzyme cleaners like Lenzyme introduce enzymes and germs into your drain system to gnaw the gunk and develop. You can use this once a month to keep your drains devoid of accumulation.
