When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your home.

Salt is typically used in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start again.</p>

If the cost of a repair is over half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more financial sense to replace your hot water heater.</p>
