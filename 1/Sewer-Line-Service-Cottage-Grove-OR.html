<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service in Cottage Grove OR?</h3>
<p>We are a licensed and insured  drain cleaning contractor who can clear out tough drain blockages and leave them working like new once again. The average cost to install a gas line for a kitchen stove is $15 to $25 per linear foot. Total expenses range from $200 to $1,000 or more depending on the length of piping required to connect to the main gas supply, which usually averages 30'.</p>
<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften tough water. Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, offering the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
