When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. There is potential for the polluted water to become a health threat if allowed to re-enter the water supply.
