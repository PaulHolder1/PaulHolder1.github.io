<p>Water softener systems work by getting rid of firmness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by neutralizing the firmness itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener option in areas where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently remove solidity from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
