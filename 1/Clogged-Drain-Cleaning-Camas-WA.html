That sluggish, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing entirely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water discolorations and deterioration.
