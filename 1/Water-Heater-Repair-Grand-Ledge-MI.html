It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage shut off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be gotten rid of from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from crucial areas in the assembly.
