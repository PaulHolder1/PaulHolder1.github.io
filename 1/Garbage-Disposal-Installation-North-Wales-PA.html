<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is negatively charged and has space to hang on to favorable ions. The fresh media starts by hanging on to the weaker charged sodium ions. As tough water goes through your water softener tank, the more powerful charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Given that the solidity minerals have a higher favorable charge than the sodium, they will knock the salt ions off and take their place.</p>
