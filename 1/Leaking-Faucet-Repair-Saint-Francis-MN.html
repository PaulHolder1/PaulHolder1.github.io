<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>

This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the 2 systems. Potential impurities can then get in the potable water system. The best method to minimize accumulation is have a professional flush it a minimum of as soon as a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is specifically tough with high mineral content, you may need to flush the hot water heater more often.</p>
