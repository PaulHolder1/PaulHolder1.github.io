<p>Pretty little flappers may get all the glory in the toilet world, however the journey lever is the bridge in between male and machine.

<p>The average life span of an electrical water heater is more than that of a gas one. Hidden sets of pipes utilize pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a different drain pathway, little pipes run from the tub and sink to eventually meet up with a bigger one beneath the toilet, carrying waste and wastewater from the bathroom and eventually out of the home.</p>
<p>During typical operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of reduced pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is created to discharge and open water to the exterior. An RPZ will periodically discharge small amounts of water due to change in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and enable adequate drainage.</p>
