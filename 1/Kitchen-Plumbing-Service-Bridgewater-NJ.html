<p>Tru-Soft ® Solar Salt water Blocks are produced for the requirements of many water softener systems. Current Review: Howard, the Task Supervisor, has always been useful and helpful relating to all our concerns. He did the proposal and arranged the work for the clear out and partial sewer line repair without delay. It is always a pleasure to work with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outside kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He was able to get a snake around the "Y", which lots of plumbers state they can't do, and clear the line. He is constantly pleasant, professional and goes the extra mile.</p>
<p>Current Review: A journeyman plumber and his assistant arrived throughout the appointed time period. They unplugged the sinks, tidied up and suggested a tool to be used in the future. How do you understand if it's time to require sewer line repair or replacement?
