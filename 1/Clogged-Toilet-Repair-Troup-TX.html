<h3>Plumbing - Leaky Faucets and Water Waste in Troup TX</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system must be continuously kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
