Water pressure may be or stop working decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water supply (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened).

<p>Inadequately set up gas lines cause gas leaks. Gas leakages are costly to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself task. The gas lines have to be adjusted to the right levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy says that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the second highest energy consuming area of a home, next to heating and cooling. The amount of minerals liquified in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>
