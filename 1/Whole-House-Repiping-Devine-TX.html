<p>Water softener systems work by removing firmness minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that assist avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to hinder the scale from developing by reducing the effects of the firmness itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners utilize a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener option in locations where it is forbidden to use salt.

<p>Hard water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it includes. When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water goes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills up with solidity ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is normally utilized in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>
<p>Throughout normal operation, the pressure in between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of lowered pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is created to open and discharge water to the exterior. An RPZ will periodically release percentages of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ ought to be installed in locations that are not subject to water damage and permit appropriate drainage.</p>
