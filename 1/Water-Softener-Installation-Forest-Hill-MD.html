<p>For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger an obstruction or can cause deterioration that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a natural gas line. Noise-- With time sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and eliminates from the capability of your water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, but if you have actually been advised by a doctor to follow a strict low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
