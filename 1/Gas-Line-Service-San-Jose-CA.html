<h3>Why Plumbers Should Install Water Heaters in San Jose CA?</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather an annoyance-- for its many designated usages around your house.</p>
