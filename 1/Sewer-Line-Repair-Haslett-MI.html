Most homes in the United States, including Tampa Bay Area, have what is referred to as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets likewise have a flapper seal made from rubber at the bottom of the cistern that keeps the water in the tank until the toilet is flushed.

It likewise has the disadvantage of increasing your water bill due to waste of water.</p>
