If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that gets rid of sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and regulates air pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually failed, it will frequently need to be changed instead of repaired. If your pipes are gurgling or producing nasty odors, you'll know this.</p>

<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
