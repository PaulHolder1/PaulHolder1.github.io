For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that speed up rust Also, there is a lack of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient kind of corrosion control. Therefore, thinking about all these factors, in addition to arise from research studies, WQA's position is that a correctly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
