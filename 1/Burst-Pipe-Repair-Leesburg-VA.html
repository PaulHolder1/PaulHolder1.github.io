<p>Garbage disposals are a vital feature in any modern-day kitchen. If you reside in an older house, your sink may not have one, requiring you to be thorough about keeping food scraps from flowing down the drain. It's also possible for a disposal to suddenly break, bringing cooking or cleanup to a grinding halt. Copper pipes = $1.50-$ 2.00 per direct foot. Copper pipes are eco-friendly and are resistant to cracking. Nevertheless, they're also the most expensive in this list and in locations with hard water (like Florida) they can develop pinhole leakages.</p>
<p>Many houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather defense. As the external finishing of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>

For this reason, it is extremely suggested you call a trusted plumber to deal with any persistent drain problems that can not be fixed with basic plunging.</p>
