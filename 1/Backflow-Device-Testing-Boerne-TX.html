<h3>Most Effective Drain Cleaning Methods Boerne TX</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can lead to leakages. As these leaks happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
