<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Jamison PA</h3>

An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a brand-new pipe. This makes building projects quickly the most common cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize huge pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
