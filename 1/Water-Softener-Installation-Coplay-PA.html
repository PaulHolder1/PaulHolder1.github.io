<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Coplay PA</h3>
<p>The most efficient method to attend to tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
