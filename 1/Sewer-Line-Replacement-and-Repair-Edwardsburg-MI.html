Its sole task is to avoid drinking water from being polluted due to backflow.</p>
<p>Many houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the outer finishing of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
