<p>Badly installed gas lines lead to gas leakages. Gas leakages are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy project. The gas lines have to be calibrated to the best levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the second highest energy consuming area of a home, beside cooling and heating. The amount of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>
