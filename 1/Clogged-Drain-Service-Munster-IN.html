<p>Water softeners leaks are mostly triggered due to the fact that of an issue at the point of installation or because of maintenance. When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated effectively. It can also cause the system to leak if the bypass valve is cracked. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or replaced gradually.
