<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal choice. A license is not required for repairs which involve just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided modifications are not made in the existing piping or components. A common water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a neighboring drainpipe or drywell.</p>

Such an upgrade conserves you money over the tenure of the new unit. The modern-day energy efficient hot water heater heat water much faster and are 20% more efficient than the older, more traditional models.
