<p>If your water heater has needed several repairs over the last few years, it may be time to get it replaced. An excellent rule of thumb for hot water heater is this: due to the fact that the life-span of the typical water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>Hot water heater repair and hot water heater installation are typically put off as long as possible. A water heater is an expensive plumbing appliance, and we tend to push off replacing it up until it breaks beyond repair. It is also a piece of plumbing equipment that we ignore until we awaken to a cold shower. We may hear the hot water heater making sounds, trying to inform us there is a problem, however we disregard it which may lead to a more extensive repair that if we would have nipped it in the bud. It is very important to get out in front of any problems as fast as possible. The quicker you respond to a concern, the better chance you'll have to save money and time on hot water heater services.</p>
