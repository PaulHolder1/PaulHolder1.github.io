<p>To identify which toilet valve is triggering the problem, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into television, there's an issue with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to trickle into the bowl. That slow, constant outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing totally. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water discolorations and rust. However do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
