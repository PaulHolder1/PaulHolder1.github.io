<p>Corrosion: The most common issue is deterioration in the tank and pipes that link to your water heater. This is especially true if you have untreated tough water, which consists of severe minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the material with time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another aspect that is causing the deterioration, you will eventually experience a leak in your hot water heater that is challenging to repair. Leakages frequently imply a brand-new system replacement is in order.</p>
<p>If you see rust only in your hot water, then examine the status of your hot water heater's anode rod. You might need a professional to do this if you've never done this on your own. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is most likely coming from the inside of your hot water heater. If this is the case, replace your water heater as quickly as possible. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your hot and cold water taps, you more than likely have actually rusted piping.</p>
