<h3>Residential Water Heater Repair and Replacement at Laughlin NV</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
