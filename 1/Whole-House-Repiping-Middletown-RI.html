<p>We Can Clean Your Drains. As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will collect in different parts of the plumbing system, the majority of typically in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can cause low flow concerns or even stop a component from flowing altogether. The next common concern that occurs with older galvanized pipes is the arterial sclerosis" of the system, which happens when the swelling of the pipes gets to be so extreme that it reduces the readily available volume of water that can flow around the system.</p>

<p>Day to day use should not cause a water softener to leak. Leakages can also happen if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the unit in a safe and steady  area. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener doesn't fall over and rip out the plumbing. You must wait till after the cycle is completed and then inspected the system for cracks or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking during regeneration. You must also inspect to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
<p>Setting up a gas line to power a hot water heater and heating system typically costs $350 to $600. On top of the gas line charges, heater installation expenses range from $2,150 to $5,900. If you're updating from electrical to gas, water heater installation costs are in between $650 and $1,600.
