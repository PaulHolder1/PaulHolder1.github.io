<p>Your sewer line is among the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being clogged or broken, it might wreak unwelcome issues on your property.

No matter what sort of water heater you have or are interested in, the specialists at Timothy Off can help. Contact us today for our water heater installation services. For example, if your kitchen sink is supported since you flushed potato peels down the disposal, a quick drain snaking can break up the obstruction and send it down the pipes. We recommend you opt for drain snaking instead of using strong chemical drain cleaners. These store-bought cleaners may do more damage than excellent by rusting your pipes.</p>
<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and bacteria from ending up being an issue in your water system by sending out an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system. The signal causes the minerals to join together, forming clusters that ultimately form stable crystals. These crystals do not cling to surface areas like individual minerals would.</p>
