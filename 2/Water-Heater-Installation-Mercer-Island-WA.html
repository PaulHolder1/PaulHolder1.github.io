Eliminate excess plumber's putty.</p>
<p>When the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be eliminated from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will collect.</p>

For this reason, the RPZ ought to be installed in locations that are exempt to water damage and allow appropriate drainage.</p>
