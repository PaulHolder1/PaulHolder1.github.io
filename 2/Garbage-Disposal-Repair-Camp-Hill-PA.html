<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so just softened water passes through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills with firmness ions, it needs to be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is usually utilized in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
<p>Secure the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the depleted salt water option after the regrowth cycle. Clamp the drain hose securely and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning drainage, all drain hoses must have an air space. The end of the hose be at least 2 inches above the devoted drain. An air gap may be used to attain this, and might be needed depending on local plumbing codes.</p>
