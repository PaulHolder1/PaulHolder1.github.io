<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that eliminates hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most terrible and common water problems: tough water.  Tough water wreaks havoc on the modern-day house. Scale develops in your pipes, clogging them and reducing water pressure.  Scale dramatically shortens the lifespan of devices like dishwashers, coffee makers and ice makers. Tough water damages warm water appliances. The greater the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and solidify into solid deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>

<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can buy models with special features that do everything but add the salt, you will pay for each extra feature. The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm warranty that the unique function will not stop working. Depending on the water source, you might need to filter turbid water or decontaminate bacteria-laden water-all prior to it even reaches the softening system. Finally, if you own a septic tank, you ought to think about the extra load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth.

<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend much more. With this approach, you know the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
