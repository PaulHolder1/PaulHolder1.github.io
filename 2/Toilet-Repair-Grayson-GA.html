<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Grayson GA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
