<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily trigger countless dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel way off schedule. So working with a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers handle all types of work. Their duties break out into 2 classifications: Plumbers who handle fundamental repairs (often in emergency circumstances), and plumbers who focus on remodeling additions and jobs.</p>
