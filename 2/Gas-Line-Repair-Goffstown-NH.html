<h3>Unclog Drains, Toilets and Sewers With The Help of Plumbers at Goffstown NH</h3>
<p>Your Kiddco sink repair plumber in Sterling can assist you select the right sink for your kitchen or bathroom if you need to replace the old sink with a brand-new one. Bathroom and kitchen sinks are made in a variety of shapes and products to fit any taste and budget. We will eliminate and dispose of the old sink, professionally install your stunning brand-new sink, re-install your old fixtures or install brand-new fixtures, connect the drain line and install the garbage disposal if you have one.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might need to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug package that I purchased separately from the disposal system. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Running cold water before, throughout, and after activating the disposal. This will help flush food particles down the drain. My sis recently had a backflow problem. Thanks for the suggestions about how you can install devices to prevent backflow and help protect your home and yard. I'll need to see about getting a company to evaluate my backflow and install a device to prevent it.</p>
