<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they need to be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at up to 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove particles such as hard water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
