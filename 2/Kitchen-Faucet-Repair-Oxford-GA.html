Blanc likewise built a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It can cleaning big commercial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was ceased in 1973.</p>
