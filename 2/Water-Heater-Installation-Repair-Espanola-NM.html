Since the solidity minerals have a greater favorable charge than the sodium, they will knock the salt ions off and take their location.</p>
<p>Extremely typically the circular blade inside is stuck. DO NOT REACH INSIDE TO FREE IT! Simply place a long, strong, wooden handle (a broom handle will be enough) into the opening. Let it rest versus the inside wall, and with force pushing down, rotate clockwise till you feel it turn freely. It may be essential to reset the disposal. Locate the reset switch on the bottom of the unit if so. Use any type of drain cleaner to release it if the clog continues.</p>
