Even if you take excellent care of your drains by covering them and avoiding pouring any liquid fat, oil, and grease down them, often clogs are unavoidable.

<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
