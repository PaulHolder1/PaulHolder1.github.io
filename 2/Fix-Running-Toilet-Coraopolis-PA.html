<p>The most efficient method to address tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
