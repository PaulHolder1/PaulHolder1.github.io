<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and pricey plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire house repiping. Plumbing problems aren't simply difficult to find, they're also capable of causing some severe damage. Pinhole leakages, for example, are so small that they only launch a couple of droplets at a time. That's far too small to trigger a drop in water pressure, or any of the other signs that may alert of a leak in the system.
