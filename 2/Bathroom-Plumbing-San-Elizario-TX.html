<p>Many houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to rust. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather condition protection. As the external finish of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
