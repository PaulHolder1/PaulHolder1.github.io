<p>Remodeling plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this method, you understand the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
