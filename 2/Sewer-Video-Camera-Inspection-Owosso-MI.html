<p>Two designs of PVBs are offered: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that includes a separately acting, spring-loaded check valve and an independently acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test cocks. A PVB may be used to isolate health or non-health risks but works versus back-siphonage just.</p>
<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then leave into the sewer or septic system from your home. When you experience clogs in numerous drains at once in your home, then that typically means that your main sewer line is backing up. This can occur in numerous areas and any combination of drains. For instance, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all link, and once you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from several drain lines in your home.</p>
<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest double flush HET used by Bonney will utilize an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We recommend, as most plumbers do, to utilize disposals sparingly. Proper care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
