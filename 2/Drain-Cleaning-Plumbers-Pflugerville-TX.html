<p>The Final Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that controls water circulation in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't installed effectively, you might experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in wasted water.</p>
