<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to prevent backflow. The basic methods of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The standard system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow.

A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
