<p>To determine which toilet valve is triggering the trouble, take a look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overflowing into the tube. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, continuous outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing totally. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water spots and corrosion. But don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
