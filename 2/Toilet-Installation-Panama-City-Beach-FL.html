Repeating repairs and leakages. If your water heater is over ten years old, it has likely lost much of its efficiency; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not affordable in the long run.

You will wish to install the softener in a dry, level location, like a basement or garage. It will need to be close to the water's main line, an electric outlet to switch on the system, and a drain for the brine service from the regeneration cycle.</p>
