Whether it's calcium, iron, or another component that is causing the rust, you will eventually experience a leak in your water heater that is challenging to repair. Leaks typically suggest a brand-new unit replacement is in order.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut down valve. They were prompt and very responsive to send me a bid which was really competitive. They were really professional and did an awesome task. I would definitely call them again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this staining just appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust probably exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is obviously still an issue that needs to be handled immediately (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) however not one that needs repiping.</p>
