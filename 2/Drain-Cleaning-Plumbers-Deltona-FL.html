These flanges are simple and commonly available to install, costing around $30 in your home improvement or hardware stores. Switch off the water supply to your house at the main line. To avoid leakages from springing throughout the installation process, shut down the supply of water to your house. Ensure your water heater's supply of water is switched off, as is the electrical power going to the unit.</p>
