<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. A license is not needed for repairs which include only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided changes are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A common water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, wide salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a close-by drainpipe or drywell.</p>
<p>Borax beings in the precise same family of water softeners as washing soda. Borax is a precipitating water softener and it includes the exact same drawbacks i.e. skin irritation and build-up.
