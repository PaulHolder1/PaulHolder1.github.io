<h3>Seven Signs You Need a Professional Sewer Cleaning at Moore SC</h3>
<p>A gas line installation will bring new opportunity to your home in regards to heating and energy. Green Planet Plumbing & Sewer is here to help if you need gas lines set up at your home or are looking into a re-pipe for your existing plumbing system. The purpose of a repair on a backflow preventer is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. The need for a repair can only be determined by conducting a field test on the assembly and knowing when the data indicates the backflow prevention assembly needs repair.</p>
<p>Garbage disposals are a vital feature in any contemporary kitchen. If you live in an older house, your sink might not have one, forcing you to be thorough about keeping food scraps from streaming down the drain. It's also possible for a disposal to all of a sudden break, bringing cooking or clean-up to a grinding halt. Copper pipes = $1.50-$ 2.00 per direct foot. Copper pipes are environmentally friendly and are resistant to splitting. However, they're likewise the most expensive in this list and in areas with hard water (like Florida) they can develop pinhole leaks.</p>
<p>If your water heater has actually required numerous repairs over the last few years, it might be time to get it replaced. A great rule of thumb for water heaters is this: since the life-span of the average water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>Inspections are required in the majority of states to ensure piping is at the required depth. For example, California has strict regulations regarding underground gas line installation because of earthquakes and other natural disasters. Piping needs to be at least 18 inches below ground for much safer areas and 24 inches for areas at greater risk of external damage.</p>
