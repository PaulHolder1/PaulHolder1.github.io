<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers carry only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. models.
