<p>If you are choosing between changing and fixing, there are a few various elements to think about. First, you need to consider for how long you have actually had your current system. A repair is more cost effective if your water heater is under 5 years. You must also opt for repairs if the issue is minor, such as a brand-new filament installation.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you've been advised by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
