<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When difficult water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water passes through to your house. As soon as the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it should be restored (cleaned). Salt is normally utilized in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>
<p>Many toilets used today operate with a standard gravity flushing style, meaning they utilize the force of the gravity to press the clean water into the bowl and after that on into the sewer system.
