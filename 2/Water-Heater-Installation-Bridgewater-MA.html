<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of significant surgical treatment, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle often. When your water lines are repiped, it simply implies old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing major and regular leakages, you might be in need of water line repiping. If you do have frequent leakages, we find that repiping can actually be the cheaper and better long-lasting service.</p>
<p>Most houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the external finish of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
