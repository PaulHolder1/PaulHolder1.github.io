<p>Both irrigation water and clean water systems are at high risk of entering contact with contaminants due to backflows. Many faucets can have a low-flow aerator installed at the outlet end of the water spout. Aerators are developed to control water flow from faucets by introducing air into the water as it streams from the spout. Adding air in this way maintains constant water pressure, which triggers the fixture to use less water.</p>

<p>The system has returned to an absolutely no demand condition (no valves open downstream). Nevertheless, debris in between the # 1 Inspect Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the parts, is preventing the # 1 Inspect from closing all the way.
