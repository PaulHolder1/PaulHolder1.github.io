<p>The most effective method to deal with tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>All devices or systems supplied by potable water lines that may be subject to contamination must have airgaps (Ct. Regs. ยง 19-13-38a( b )).
