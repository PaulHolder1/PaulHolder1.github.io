By having the anode rod inspected regularly and replaced as needed, you can double the life of your water heater.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>

Several houses in my neighborhood being repiped and have actually spoken to next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this. If the leak isn't found quickly, apparently it begins with pin hole leaks in the copper piping and can cause major damage.</p>
