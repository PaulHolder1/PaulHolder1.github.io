<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a few years of gunk and had actually backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did a minimum of three efforts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his understanding and experience he figured out that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the freshly cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and patience the job was done to my complete satisfaction.</p>
