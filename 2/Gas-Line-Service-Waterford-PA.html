The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage just for non-health danger or health risk conditions. They must be set up downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. , if an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you should install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.. It should also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB producers, and some local officials, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet).

At the least, it would have been a very expensive alternative.</p>
