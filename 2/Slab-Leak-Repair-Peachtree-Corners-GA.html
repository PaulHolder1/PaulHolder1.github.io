<p>We had roots through our sewer line so it was regularly obstructing. They came out and dug a new route for the line connected it to the sewer and whatever. It was brutally hot and I really appreciate their effort to enable us to utilize our water centers once again. Had a fantastic experience with these folks. I highly recommend their services.</p>
<p>Many softeners have actually a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you need to offer some type of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it.

At the least, it would have been a very expensive option.</p>
