<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They instantly cleared the initial clog, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
