Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
