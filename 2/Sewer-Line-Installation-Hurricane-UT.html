<p>Most plumbers will get rid of the old unit to install the brand-new one at the exact same hourly rate. This can increase the amount of time required to install the new system, therefore increasing expenses. This actually depends upon what condition the rest of the pipes are in, and how difficult the old system is to eliminate. Oftentimes, elimination will just add an extra $25 to $50 to the total costs, but in some cases the expenses could be higher if additional pipes need to also be replaced.</p>
<p>Push the tip of a screwdriver up versus the edge of the plug and tap until you break out the plug. Then eliminate this plastic disc from inside the disposal (you can probably hold the unit upside down and shake it out). There are different types and styles of sink faucets, and your Hero plumber understands how to repair them all, and can also provide installation of a new faucet if needed. We have total self-confidence that we can manage any kind of repair you toss at us.</p>
