<h3>How To Fix Burst Water Pipes Cayce SC</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
