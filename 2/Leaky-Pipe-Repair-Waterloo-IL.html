<p>Rust: The most common issue is corrosion in the tank and pipes that connect to your water heater.

Whether it's calcium, iron, or another aspect that is triggering the corrosion, you will ultimately experience a leak in your water heater that is difficult to repair. Leakages frequently mean a new system replacement remains in order.</p>
