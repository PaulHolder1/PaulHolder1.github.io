<p>Most homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather condition defense. As the external finish of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
