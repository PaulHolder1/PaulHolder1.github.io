<p>Whenever you flush your toilet, you'll see that water runs to fill up the bowl. However, in an effectively working toilet, the water must stop running when the bowl is filled to its proper capability. If your toilet continues to run, opportunities are you have an internal leak and water is being dumped down the overflow. These leakages are very wasteful, as more than a hundred gallons of water end up traveling through the overflow.</p>
