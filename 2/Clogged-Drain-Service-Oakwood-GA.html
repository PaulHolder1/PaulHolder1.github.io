The salt water service must be blended and stored in the salt water tank. Regular blocking of the resin also needs unique attention. For example, if the raw water supply is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, regular backwashing with water will resolve this issue. If not, gradually stir the resin during the backwash cycle to assist separate the material. Likewise, fungis and germs likewise form mats in the resin that reduce its effectiveness. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or occasionally cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these annoyances. However, read the manufacturer's directions prior to including any chemicals to the system.</p>
<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and germs from becoming a problem in your water supply by sending out an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system.
