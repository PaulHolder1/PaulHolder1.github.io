<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system needs to be constantly monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>Liners are another popular item sewer cleaners sell nowadays. A liner is a cloth tube covered on one side with a layer of PVC, which is embedded with a two-part epoxy resin. Provider then generally blow the liner into an existing pipe. If your house was constructed prior to the 1970s or hasn't been renovated, you will probably have old pipes that need changing.</p>
