<h3>An Easy Approach To Find A Reliable Plumber Knightdale NC</h3>
<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is adversely charged and has space to hold on to favorable ions. The fresh media starts by hanging on to the weaker charged sodium ions. As tough water goes through your water softener tank, the stronger charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Since the firmness minerals have a higher favorable charge than the salt, they will knock the salt ions off and take their location.</p>
