<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has often been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due mostly to overstated advertising and, in part, to customer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening merely gets rid of firmness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a nuisance and not a hazard to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not requirement. However, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
<p>Prevention is much better than cure. If you have a well or an irrigation system, you need to install a backflow device on your water supply. Discolored water- Your water should constantly be clear. Discolored water signifies rust in your pipes or water heater. This warrants professional attention if your water is an uncommon color. New gas line installations are provided for brand-new appliances like burners, ranges, outdoor lighting, and grills. Products include pipes, fasteners and valves. The size of the pipes should be proportional to the size of the appliance being set up.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization appropriately collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
