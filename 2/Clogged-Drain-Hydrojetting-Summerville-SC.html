<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the best is typical in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
