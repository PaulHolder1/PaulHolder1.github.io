<p>As discussed earlier in the post, carbon monoxide is colorless and completely odor free. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every house should have carbon monoxide detectors installed at the appropriate places. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family houses to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are generally sold as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new installations need to have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>
<p>Backpressure is created when pressure in a water supply surpasses the pressure in the drinkable system supplying the make-up water.

In some locations of Virginia, where the water is specifically hard with high mineral content, you might need to flush the water heater more often.</p>
