<p>A garbage disposal must not leak. When this takes place, it generally shows wear and tear which is a reasonable indication that its time is up.

The kitchen sink drain might need a basic tightening up or a replacement. If the leak is in the pressurized hose spray, you will see the apparent spray. For a leak in the drain pipe, you may need to fill the sink with water prior to examining the pipe beneath.</p>
<p>The level 3 of maintenance your disposal unit will need can differ depending on how often it's used, its age, and the kind of products you're putting in it.
