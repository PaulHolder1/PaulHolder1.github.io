<p>A number of organizations, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) use accreditation courses designed to train professionals to test backflow preventers.

When the pressure drops for some reason such as may take place when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to combat a water or a fire main breaks or some other scenario occurs, contaminated water might be drawn into the system. To prevent such an occurrence, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention technique made use of.

If an air gap is not possible, then the proper backflow prevention device is needed. This backflow device is thought about a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Epa and your water provider.</p>
