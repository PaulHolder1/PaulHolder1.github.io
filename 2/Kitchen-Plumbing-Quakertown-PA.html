<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services Quakertown PA</h3>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Regrettably, main line clogs are not something a property owner can fix.

TLC can make use of a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line.

<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
