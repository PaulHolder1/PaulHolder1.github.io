<h2>Tips To Hire Professional Plumbing Companies in Bethpage</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Spotty meals? Circulation pipes transition to even smaller sized private service pipes, carrying water to individual houses, apartment stores, structures and businesses. Depending on need, these pipes vary in size from a half inch in size to 6 inches. Water enters the consumer center by means of a water meter that tape-records circulation rates and water usage for billing purposes. Private service pipelines are normally made from plastic, lead or Type K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be vital.</p>
<p>If there is backflow at your home, you might contaminate your drinking water with non-treated water from an irrigation canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it. Also, if you use your hose to fill a wading swimming pool or hot tub, a turnaround of the water circulation could siphon swimming pool or day spa chemicals back through the garden hose and into your home's plumbing.</p>

Easements (typically 10 feet broad) where main drains pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>
