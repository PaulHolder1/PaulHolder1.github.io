<p>We utilize quality products. In a lot of instances, we attempt to use versatile carbon steel to carry gas from the exterior gas source to appliances. Flexible steel removes the need to cut and piece private sections of piping together which minimizes potential for gas leakages. Carbon steel possesses additives that can stand up to particular conditions during component direct exposure. When a leak takes place, Tracer wire is frequently used with flexible carbon steel to alert the gas company. We can make sure that these lines are working appropriately.</p>

<p>A new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of worn thin pipe and the painting the within the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Often throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes. Some of those thin spots leak right now and in some cases those leakages come days or weeks later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up requiring to be properly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
