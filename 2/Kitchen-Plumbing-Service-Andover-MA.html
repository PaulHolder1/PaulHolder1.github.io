<h3>The Importance of Drain Cleaning and How it Affects Your Home in Andover MA</h3>
<p>We had roots through our sewer line so it was frequently obstructing. They came out and dug a new path for the line connected it to the sewer and whatever. It was brutally hot and I truly value their effort to allow us to utilize our water centers again. Had a fantastic experience with these folks. I highly suggest their services.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. A lot of home centers carry only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. Also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
