Like any home appliance, a toilet tank includes lots of little moving parts that might need changed with usage with time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and cause toilet leakages that aren't clearly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that undergo fouling, wear or tiredness. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be checked occasionally to guarantee they are functioning correctly. A visual check of air gaps is sufficient, however mechanical backflow preventers need to be tested with effectively adjusted gauge equipment.</p>
