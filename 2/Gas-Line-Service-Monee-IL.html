<p>Water softeners leaks are mostly triggered because of a problem at the point of installation or since of maintenance. When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated appropriately. It can also trigger the system to leak if the bypass valve is split. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or replaced in time. A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regrowth procedures. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely broken and just needs to be replaced.</p>
