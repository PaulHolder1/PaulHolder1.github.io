<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it includes. When difficult water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water goes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it needs to be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is typically utilized in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are set up in areas where water might cause catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>
