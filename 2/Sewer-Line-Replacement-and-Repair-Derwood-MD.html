That slow, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing totally. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water spots and corrosion.
