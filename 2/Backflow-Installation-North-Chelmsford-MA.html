<h3>Plumbing Company Serving North Chelmsford MA</h3>

The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and benefit back siphonage just for non-health hazard or health risk conditions. They must be set up downstream from any shut off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to also be set up a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) greater than the greatest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, require that they be installed 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet). Some towns do not enable the usage of GFAVB's. These units will NOT avoid backflow pressure and can just secure against back siphonage.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede against the needed instructions of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. There is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health risk if allowed to return to the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected routinely for efficiency, in addition to inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
