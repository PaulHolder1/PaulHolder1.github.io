<p>When the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback turned off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be removed from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from crucial areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>
