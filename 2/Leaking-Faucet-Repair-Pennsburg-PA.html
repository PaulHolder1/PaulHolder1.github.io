<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
<p>Other pipe repair strategies include our Pipe Pull technique and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull strategy interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a tiny hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into place. All new replacement pipes have a projected lifespan of one hundred years and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another reliable method is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically gets rid of the need for broken pipe elimination. By inserting a hardening lining material which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a brand-new pipe is created inside the broken one.</p>
