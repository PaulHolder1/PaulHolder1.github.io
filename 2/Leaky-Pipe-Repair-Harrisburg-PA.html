<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service Harrisburg PA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
