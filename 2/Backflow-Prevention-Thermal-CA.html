<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Thermal CA</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some people state, doesn't the water pressure in the water system keep the irrigation water from reversing? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does happen regularly than you believe! Typically it happens at night when you do not observe the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or attach a new pipe. This makes construction tasks easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another common reason for backflow. Fire engine utilize big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This often triggers the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding neighborhoods.</p>

If an air gap is not possible, then the correct backflow prevention device is required. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water provider.</p>
