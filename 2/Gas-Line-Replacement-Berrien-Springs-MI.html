<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Berrien Springs MI</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can cause leakages. As these leaks take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these issues.</p>

<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the first most obvious signs of a sewer problem is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be).

<p>Most houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to supply weather condition security. As the outer finish of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
