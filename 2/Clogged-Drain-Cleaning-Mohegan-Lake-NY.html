<h3>Fix a Leaky Outside Frost Free Faucet in Mohegan Lake NY</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly pleased with their service.</p>
<p>2 styles of PVBs are offered: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. A PVB might be used to isolate health or non-health dangers but works versus back-siphonage only.</p>
