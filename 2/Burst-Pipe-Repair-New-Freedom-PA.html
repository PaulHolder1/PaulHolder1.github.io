<p>Many houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather security. As the outer finish of zinc begins to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the reason for the problem. The line was clearly weakening; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
