A garbage disposal usually plugs into a 120-volt GFCI (ground-fault circuit interruptor) outlet under the sink. If an outlet like this isn't readily available under your sink, you'll have to have an electrical expert install one.</p>
<p>Garbage disposal guarantees last approximately 5 years, however they can range in between 2 and 10 years. Given that the typical life expectancy of a waste disposal unit is 12 years, you might want to purchase an extended warranty.
