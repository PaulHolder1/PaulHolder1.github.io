<p>For the most part, the toilet can be fixed instead of changed, because the problem often comes down to a single element or more. Often, however, the damage is so extensive that you either need to replace the whole toilet, or the cost of repairs is so large that replacement is just a more practical option. This typically involves cracks in the toilet bowl itself, extensive deterioration over numerous components, or merely since you  want to replace your existing toilet with something more visually pleasing.</p>
<p>Extremely typically the circular blade within is stuck. DO NOT REACH INSIDE TO FREE IT! Merely insert a long, tough, wooden handle (a broom manage will be enough) into the opening. Let it rest versus the inside wall, and with force pushing down, rotate clockwise up until you feel it turn easily. It might be essential to reset the disposal. Locate the reset switch on the bottom of the system if so. Use any type of drain cleaner to release it if the clog persists.</p>
