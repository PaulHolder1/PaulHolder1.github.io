For the most part, a sink drain concern is caused by extreme pollutants or debris inside the drain like hair, grease, hair care items or soaps. While there are several chemical drain cleaning alternatives, in some cases this can cause more damage than aid. Anytime you discover a clogged drain, reach out to Resurrection Plumbing to detect the problem and recommend the right repairs.</p>
<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Rule, General. Within the structure envelope consisting of below grade, if less than 10-percent (nominal) of the existing piping for a sub-system, fixture, or system  group is changed, an authorization and inspection will not be needed. If so wanted, this will not preclude the licensee from obtaining licenses and inspections for such work.</p>
<p>It might be time to get it changed if your water heater has required multiple repairs over the last few years. An excellent rule of thumb for water heaters is this: since the life-span of the typical hot water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
