<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
