<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Loganville GA</h3>
<p>Many plumbing concerns involve interruptions and clogged drains or pipes. If all of your DIY efforts don't work, blockages in the sink, bathtub, shower and toilets may be covered by an American House Shield plumbing warranty depending upon the cause.

<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc connected to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, enabling air to bring back and go into the valve pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
