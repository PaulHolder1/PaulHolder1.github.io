<p>The toilet takes a really long period of time to flush. Here's how it works: During typical operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves-- described as the zone of decreased pressure-- is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve ought to leak, the relief valve is developed to discharge and open water to the outside, guaranteeing backflow never ever occurs.</p>

This can take place in several locations and any mix of drains. For example, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several mixes of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>
