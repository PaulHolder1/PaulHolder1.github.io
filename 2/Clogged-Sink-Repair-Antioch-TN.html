<p>Atmospheric vacuum breakers (AVB) are the most basic design of backflow preventer. If you have less than six control valves, they are the least costly, but also the least reliable choice.

<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts.

<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
