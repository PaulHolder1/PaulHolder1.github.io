If you spot a leak and select a patching task instead of a repiping task, simply bear in mind that all the pipes in your house are most likely made from the very same material and they may be next. To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to consider repiping your whole house when you identify a leak.</p>
