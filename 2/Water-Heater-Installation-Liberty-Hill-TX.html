<p>When choosing the correct system defense there are a number of factors to consider we need to look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation ought to be taken a look at on an individual basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of lawn sprinkler contains the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire protection system are created to match the threat that exists in the areas they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be extremely different, we need to understand that the fire defense system for any installation needs to be designed and installed to fulfill that specific risk or need. An airplane hangar will need a very different fire protection system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow protection requirements for these two examples would likewise differ significantly.</p>
