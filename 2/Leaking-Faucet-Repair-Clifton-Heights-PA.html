A normal water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, broad brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a close-by drain or drywell.</p>
<p>If there is backflow at your home, you could contaminate your drinking water with non-treated water from an irrigation canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it. Also, if you utilize your hose to fill a wading pool or jacuzzi, a reversal of the water circulation could siphon pool or health spa chemicals back through the garden hose and into your house's plumbing.</p>
