<p>Know that softened water contains trace amounts of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water includes about the same amount of salt as a piece of bread. That's not very much salt, but for those on a stringent sodium-free diet plan it might be excessive. If this does not work, you may need to replace one of your toilet's parts, normally the flapper.
