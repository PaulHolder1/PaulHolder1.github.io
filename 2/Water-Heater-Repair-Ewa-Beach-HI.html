Storage tank hot water heater are typically discovered in the majority of homes. Their components are an insulated tank, normally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water till it's required.

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the perpetrator. But not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
