Some disposer units do not included a power cord attached. Get rid of the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1) if this is the case. Be sure to buy a wiring kit with the appropriate power ranking and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). Make sure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cable when you link the electrical wiring harness to the disposer.</p>
