<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Roslyn Heights NY?</h3>
<p>What is difficult water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium.

While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a nuisance-- for its lots of intended uses around your home.</p>
