<p>Woodbury, along with lots of other neighborhoods and organizations, has actually found the very best method to prevent these spots from happening is by decreasing the variety of times your water softener regenerates. "Regrowing" refers to the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it becomes "exhausted" or full. Nevertheless, many water softeners regenerate too often, when the filter medium really isn't complete. This can be corrected by simply resetting your water softener to eliminate less hardness or to run longer between regeneration cycles.</p>

Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet.
