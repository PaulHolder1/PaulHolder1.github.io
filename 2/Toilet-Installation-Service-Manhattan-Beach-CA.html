AVB's are not testable and it is not possible to find when one has actually stopped working.</p>
<p>When you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or fractures. Replacing a bad washer is inexpensive and easy. But finding the best washer may not be. The most common washers are frequently available at home centers and hardware shops. Other styles can be tough to find.
