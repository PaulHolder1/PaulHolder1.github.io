For this reason, the RPZ ought to be set up in locations that are exempt to water damage and permit appropriate drainage.</p>

<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and elsewhere during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood.
