<p>During regular operation, the pressure between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of minimized pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is designed to discharge and open water to the outside. An RPZ will occasionally discharge percentages of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ ought to be set up in locations that are exempt to water damage and permit appropriate drainage.</p>

<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and elsewhere during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a versatile structure.
