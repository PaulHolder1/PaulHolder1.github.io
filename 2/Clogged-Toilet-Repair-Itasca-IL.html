<p>It's a great idea to have a professional examine your drain system if you experience clogs and backups in your house more than a couple of times. A drain specialist like TLC will utilize a camera to inspect your drain system. Frequently, if you have multiple drain problems you might have a drain line break someplace in your house or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can determine the problem and locate so the drain can be repaired.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might need to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug set that I purchased independently from the disposal system. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>A minimum of 12 inches of clear space will be preserved above the assembly to allow for servicing check valves and for operation of shut-off valves.
