That odor might be coming from your sewer system, which needs repair right now. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your house, launches sewer gas, and regulates atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has stopped working, it will often need to be changed rather than fixed. If your pipes are gurgling or producing nasty smells, you'll know this.</p>

<p>When a leak develops under the structure of your residential or commercial property or in walls behind vanities and bathtubs it is often a better choice to simply replace the whole damaged water supply. At Rainaldi, we are specialists in repiping.

<p>At least as soon as every 3 months, drain water from the tank. With time sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can hinder efficiency, and draining pipes a gallon or two helps get rid of the sediment. If you find a leak and choose a patching job instead of a repiping job, simply bear in mind that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the same product and they may be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to consider repiping your entire house when you find a leak.</p>
