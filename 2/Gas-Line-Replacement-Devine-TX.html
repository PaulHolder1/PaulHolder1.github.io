<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if appropriate). If your system is outlet-ready-- focus on this part-- make certain your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the brand-new system in.

Not that I would know from experience.</p>

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and figure out the reason for the issue. The line was plainly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
