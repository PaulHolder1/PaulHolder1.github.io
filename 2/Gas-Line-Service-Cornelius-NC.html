<p>After getting here after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together however declared they would not take duty if it dripped now since of some unspecified quirks in how my sink was created. After they provided me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, because I never ever want to see this company again.</p>

I was prepared to spend at least $500 for a hot water system and he stated it wasn't needed!!!! He could have installed the system and I 'd never have actually understood the distinction. That's a quality organisation. . Setting up a garbage disposal is a reasonably simple project for a knowledgeable do-it-yourselfer. Grab a couple of basic tools and follow our how-to.</p>
