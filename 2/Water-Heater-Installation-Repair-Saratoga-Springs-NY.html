<p>We truly appreciate our consumers and the services that we provide. As difficult water passes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade places with sodium ions (Figure 1). Salt ions are held loosely and are changed quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. During this procedure, free" salt ions are released into the water. The time in between recharging cycles depends upon the hardness of the water, the quantity of water used, the size of the unit and the capacity of the exchange media to get rid of solidity.</p>
<p>For RPZ gadgets, drainage capacity shall be sized to accommodate both periodic discharges and a disastrous failure of the relief valve. Describe producers circulation curves to figure out optimal discharge rate based upon supply pressure or on-site pressure; whichever is greater.
