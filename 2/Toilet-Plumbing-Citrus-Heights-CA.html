<p>There are a couple of indications that will let you understand you have a gas line leak in your home, and it is necessary to take notice of them. If you notice a strong odor that resembles rotten eggs, then the gas pipe may be punctured or harmed. You may also hear a hissing sound as the gas is leaving from the line, but that isn't always the case. If you smell rotten eggs, it is important to take action quickly to avoid any severe problems and to keep everyone safe.</p>
<p>Inspections are required in most states to ensure piping is at the needed depth. For example, California has strict regulations regarding underground gas line installation because of earthquakes and other natural catastrophes. Piping ought to be at least 18 inches listed below ground for more secure locations and 24 inches for locations at greater danger of external damage.</p>
