<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the very first time, there are a few things worth understanding about garbage disposal installation.

<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving hard, crusty mineral deposits. Initially, these little deposits are safe, but over time they develop and eventually clog pipes, take valves, and plug aerators and showerheads. In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically restrict the water circulation, which puts undue pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
