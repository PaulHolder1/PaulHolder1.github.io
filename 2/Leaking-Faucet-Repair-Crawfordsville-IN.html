<p>In water distribution systems, water is normally maintained at a considerable pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may fail or be lowered when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
