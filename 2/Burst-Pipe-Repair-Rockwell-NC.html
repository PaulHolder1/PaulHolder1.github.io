<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>

Our extensive water quality program runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water delivered to our clients is kept free from damaging impurities. A vital part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to equipment containing a nonpotable compound, this is known as a cross-connection.
