<h3>Some of the Best Tips for Dealing With Drain Problems in Kew Gardens NY</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system must be continuously kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
