A cracked rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the offender. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regeneration procedures. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. It is likely broken and simply requires to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
