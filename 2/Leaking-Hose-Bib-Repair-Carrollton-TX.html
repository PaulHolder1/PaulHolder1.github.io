<p>However, you likewise need to consider the age of your system.

<p>Take the example of the instantaneous hot shower that uses the point-of-use water heaters; these home appliances will provide hot water constantly for the duration you are using the shower. They will stop to work only if there are power concerns or if the water heater is defective. In essence, it heats up the water on demand with simply the quantity you need, therefore taking away the loss incurred with using tank hot water heater where the water cools and is then reheated.</p>
