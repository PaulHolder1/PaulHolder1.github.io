<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a moveable disc attached to a climatic vent. In case of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, enabling air to enter the valve and restore pressure equivalent to ambient atmospheric standard. This restoration of pressure breaks the siphon and prevents cross contamination.</p>
