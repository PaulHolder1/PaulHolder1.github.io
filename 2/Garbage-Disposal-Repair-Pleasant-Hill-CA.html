<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leakages happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
