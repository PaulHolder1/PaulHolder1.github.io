Fire protection system are designed to match the threat that exists in the places they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be extremely various, we need to comprehend that the fire defense system for any installation requires to be designed and set up to fulfill that specific risk or need. An aircraft hangar will need a very different fire security system than the system required in an apartment. The backflow security requirements for these 2 examples would also vary greatly.</p>
