Over time, dirt, debris, hair, and many other little particles can get caught and build up in your pipes. Eventually, the water may not have the ability to drain quickly or efficiently, and you might experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is continuously supporting. It might be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to examine when this occurs.</p>

At these occurances, water flow can be reversed. This reversal can produce a suction effect and draw potential pollutants into the safe and clean (drinking) water system. Tank water heaters are frequently found in many homes. Their elements are an insulated tank, normally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and shop the water up until it's needed. A pipe emerges from the leading to provide hot water to its location, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
