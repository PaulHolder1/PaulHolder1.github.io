<p>Wooden pipes were used in London and in other places throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure.
