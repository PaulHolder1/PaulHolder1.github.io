<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Ashland OH</h3>
<p>Leaking gas can lead to asphyxiation and dangerous explosions. Thankfully, commercial gasses, such as the kind a gas stove or heater uses, have a strong smell added to them so that leaks can be more quickly found by homeowners. If you smell a gas leak in your home, you need to act rapidly - contact Abacus Plumbing NOW at 713-766-3605 713 -766 -3605 Likewise, alert your gas company.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
