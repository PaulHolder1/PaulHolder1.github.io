<h3>Clogged Pipes in Ocean City Maryland</h2>
<p>The source or place of a sewer problem determines who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another.

Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main sewage systems pass through private property are an exception to this guideline.</p>

The majority of these plastic pipe systems will end in lawsuits. Part of the problem is with the fittings that are often inexpensively made with little quality assurance by a verity of overseas companies. Plastic pipes also have questionable signing up with approaches. Plastic pipes are glued, crimped, and banded. When plastic pipes blow a joint they blow apart and result in water damage. Plastics become fragile with age and heat. There are also problems about the molecular structure of plastics and the resins from which they are made.</p>
