Depending upon how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a problem-- for its lots of desired usages around your home.</p>
