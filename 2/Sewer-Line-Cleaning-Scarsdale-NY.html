<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>

<p>Although these house owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline prior to the issue became worse. Waiting simply wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a very costly choice.</p>
