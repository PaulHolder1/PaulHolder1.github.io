If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't set up properly, you may experience a regularly or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in squandered water.</p>

To prevent such an event, there requires to be some type of backflow prevention approach made use of. The very best and most safe kind of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the component). If an air gap is not possible, then the correct backflow prevention device is needed.
