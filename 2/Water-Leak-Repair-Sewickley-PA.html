<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the required direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. If permitted to re-enter the supply of water, there is capacity for the polluted water to become a health hazard. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for efficiency, as well as inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
