<p>After arriving after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen tossed up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but claimed they would not take duty if it dripped now since of some undefined curiosity in how my sink was created. After they provided me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, since I never wish to see this company once again.</p>
<p>Even if you aren't doing a complete kitchen remodel, many people change out their kitchen sinks since their old one is stained, cracked, or otherwise harmed; or because they just desire a brand-new kitchen sink configuration with more depth, 2 areas, or a different shape. We will help you avoid the risks of incorrect sink installation, making sure that your brand-new sink suits the spot you have, all pipes are practical, caulking is tight, and the sink looks and works excellent.</p>
