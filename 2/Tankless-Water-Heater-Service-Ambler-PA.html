<p>Anti-Scale Devices: Some water heaters promote functions that decrease mineral scale accumulation by churning water in the bottom of the tank.

Chlorinated Polyvinylchloride Piping (CPVC) piping materials cost from $0.40 to $1.56 per linear foot.

CPVC is simple to install and fulfills the most strenuous building codes.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many home centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
