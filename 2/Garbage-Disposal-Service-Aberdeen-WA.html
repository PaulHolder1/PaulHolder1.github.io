<p>The majority of toilets used today operate with a standard gravity flushing style, indicating they utilize the force of the gravity to press the clean water into the bowl and then on into the sewage system. Recently, however, toilets utilizing a vacuum flushing system have actually been appearing in more and more houses. This system utilizes a vacuum-assisted flushing system to draw the water into the bowl and down into the drains. A downside of this device is that it's much more challenging to unclog your toilet were to become clogged.</p>
