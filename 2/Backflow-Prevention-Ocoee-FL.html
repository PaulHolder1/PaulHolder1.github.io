<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line blockages are not something a property owner can fix. This kind of clog requires a professional plumber or drain technician to utilize a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are geared up with this type of camera to determine and repair the drain problem. If you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is specifically helpful in finding an issue.</p>
<p>When lime is added to the water, it changes the water chemistry, causing the calcium to come out of the solution. The particles of calcium integrate, become much heavier than the rest of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next step of the treatment process. Versatile gas lines are normally more effective to inflexible lines, particularly in areas where earthquakes are more common and for the connection between the supply and device. Versatile gas lines are less likely to be detached in a natural catastrophe which reduces the threat of a surge or fire.</p>
