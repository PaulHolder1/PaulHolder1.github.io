<h3>Fast Emergency Plumbers Near Me Richmond MO</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
