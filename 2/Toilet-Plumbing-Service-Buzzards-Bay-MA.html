<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a significant clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
