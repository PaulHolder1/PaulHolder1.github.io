Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is small, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
