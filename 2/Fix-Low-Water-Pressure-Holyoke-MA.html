Fire protection system are designed to match the danger that exists in the locations they are set up in. As building types and contents of these structures can be really different, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be created and installed to satisfy that specific danger or need. An aircraft garage will need a really various fire security system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow defense requirements for these two examples would also differ significantly.</p>
