<p>These days, we have actually grown familiar with having warm water available at all times. At Plumb Perfect Plumbing, we understand that you need instant plumbing services when your water heater starts to break down. If your unit is no longer able to produce hot water, is visibly leaking, or is making odd noises, it is essential you have a professionally experienced and experienced Fredericksburg plumber take a look as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>While lots of water heater problems can be efficiently fixed, some problems will require total hot water heater replacement. If your water heater is past its normal life-span (usually anywhere from 8 to ten years or longer if you have a tankless water heater) or if it has a significant leak or substantial rust, it may be time to consider replacement.</p>
<p>A plumbing authorization attends to three inspections. Extra inspections are $50.00 each. Inspections called in on work not completed, not appropriately set up, or on an unattainable home will require re-inspection. It is the permit holder's responsibility to reschedule the inspection and make arrangements for the plumbing inspector to access the property.</p>
<p>Single flush High Performance Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent double flush HET offered by Bonney will use an average of 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We recommend, as most plumbers do, to utilize disposals moderately. Correct care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
