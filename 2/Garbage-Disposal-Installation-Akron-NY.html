<p>The majority of homes or structures that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to supply weather condition protection. As the outer coating of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional investigation, there was a significant blockage that required excavation to examine. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
