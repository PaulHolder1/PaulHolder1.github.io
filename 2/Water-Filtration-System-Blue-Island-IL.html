<p>When picking the correct system protection there are numerous factors to consider we need to look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation must be looked at on an individual basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of sprinkler systems includes the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves.

<p>Softeners mainly remove calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are often referred to as 'firmness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they must be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a huge warning that something more major is incorrect with them.</p>
<p>Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline prior to the issue worsened. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a really expensive option.</p>
