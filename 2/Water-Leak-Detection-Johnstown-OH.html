<p>Backflow preventers are crucial for developing a safe water supply system. No matter which model you choose, all water softeners need to be properly kept. The salt water solution should be mixed and stored in the salt water tank. Regular obstructing of the resin likewise needs unique attention. For instance, if the raw water supply is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Often, typical backwashing with water will solve this issue. If not, slowly stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Also, fungis and germs also form mats in the resin that reduce its efficiency. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these nuisances. However, check out the producer's directions before adding any chemicals to the system.</p>
<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to get rid of the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and lots of other minerals carry positive charges, so water softeners utilize sodium ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions.
