<h3>Things To Know Before Hiring A Sewer Cleaning Company at Lodi NJ</h3>
<p>Backflow is dangerous due to the fact that it can contaminate the public drinking supply with pollutants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and hazardous chemicals. In 2010, for instance, students at a Bowling Green, Kentucky grade school suffered queasiness and other signs after a contractor working on the HEATING AND COOLING system caused the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health danger if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, caused the spread of illness or disease.</p>
