<p>Supplying quality and professional repair, replacement, and installation services for your plumbing. Some jurisdictions also permit options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This gets rid of the need for a backflow preventer, because each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>

There might also be a concern with the chain connected to the float or the flapper ball. A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>
