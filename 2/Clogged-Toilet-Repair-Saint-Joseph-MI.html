I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 â² hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
