<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Farmington UT</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
<p>The watering backflow testing season is from May to September.
