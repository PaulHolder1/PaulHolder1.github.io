<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are set up in areas where water could cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

<h3>Useful Tips for Water Heater Repair at El Cajon CA</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
