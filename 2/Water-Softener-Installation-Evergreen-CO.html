<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
