Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have actually been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself.

If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

I was super happy with their service.</p>
