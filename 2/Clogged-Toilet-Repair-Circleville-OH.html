<p>As one of the most used plumbing units in your home, it's a considered that your toilet will need repairs over time. But if your toilet is exhibiting any of the following signs, it may be time to replace it. We examine backflow requirements for businesses on an individual basis when a water account is developed. After getting rid of standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain before you gather the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and then flush with hot water to clear the mix.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Many home centers carry only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
