<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Montrose PA</h3>

For several years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that speed up corrosion Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient type of rust control. Therefore, considering all these aspects, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
