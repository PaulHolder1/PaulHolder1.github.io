<p>Sewer lines can fail for a range of reasons, including poor soil conditions, obstructions from grease and grime, and deterioration. Even bushes and trees can trigger problems for sewer lines, specifically in older communities where clay pipe might have been used. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be two times as compounded if pipes have been allowed to freeze.</p>
<p>Place the epoxy on the gas line. It is essential to follow the application procedure detailed in the package. Leave it in, ideally overnight, for it to treat and hold securely. Once treated, tighten up the fittings on the high-pressure gas line. Its time now to re-install the low-pressure gas line as soon as this is done.
