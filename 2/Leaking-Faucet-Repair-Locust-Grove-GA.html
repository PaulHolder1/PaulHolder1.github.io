Each stage in the water supply and distribution system needs to deal with differing flow rates, flow speeds and pressure heads, along with different levels of direct exposure to prospective backwash or contaminant seepage and the subsequent need for defense with backflow preventers.</p>
<p>A house's service line (also referred to as a sewer lateral) ranges from your house to the mainline sewer in the street. In many cases, the property owner is responsible for keeping the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for preserving the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>

However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow takes place. No, it is not a frequent incident, but it does take place more often than you think! Often it happens during the night when you don't see the water was off for a couple of minutes.
