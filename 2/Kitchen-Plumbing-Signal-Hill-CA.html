Low Circulation Toilets: While low flow toilets are terrific at saving you money on your water costs, some older models do not have the flushing power to appropriately eliminate waste, which causes buildups.</p>

<p>Water softeners been available in all sizes and shapes and bigger definitely does not indicate better. WaterBoss ® utilizes fine mesh resin - smaller beads that really provide more area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to permit optimal capacity in a minimum of space. Plus, our patented Directional Flow Screen system assists make sure that no resin bead goes unused.

That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market.

The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
