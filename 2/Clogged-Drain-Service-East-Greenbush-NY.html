<h3>Slab Leak Reroute in East Greenbush New York</h2>
<p>The upstairs main kitchen drain was clogged with a couple of years of gunk and had backed up into the downstairs bathroom sink. Mr. Singh did at least 3 attempts to clear the main drain, but the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Utilizing his knowledge and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my pleasure, the sink cleared and all the particles went down the freshly cleaned up main drain. By including perseverence and persistence the job was done to my total satisfaction.</p>
