<p>When the end user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water streams in the typical direction from the provider, downstream to fill the user's need. The flow of water presses the spring-loaded check valves open. The stress of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure distinction in the Zone of Minimized Pressure. This difference in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water streams in the regular instructions.</p>
