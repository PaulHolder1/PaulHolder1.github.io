<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future.
