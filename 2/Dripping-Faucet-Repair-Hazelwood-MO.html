Unlike a drip leg, the flow of the gas is altered to get rid of any sediment. A sediment trap might be included in a drip leg install.

These gadgets undergo testing by a certified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In a lot of cases, they undergo routine tests later on, too.</p>
