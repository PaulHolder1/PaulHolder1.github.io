<p>. Backflow into a public water system can pollute the water or pollute because system (i.e., backflow into a public water system can make the water in that system unsafe or unusable to drink), and each water provider has a responsibility to provide water that is functional and safe to consume under all foreseeable circumstances. In addition, customers normally have outright faith that water provided to them through a public water system is constantly safe to drink. For these reasons, your water district must take safety measures to protect its public water supply against backflow.</p>
<p>Then connect the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if applicable). If your unit is outlet-ready-- pay attention to this part-- ensure your disposal switch is in the off" position before you plug the brand-new unit in. While it's unlikely that having a disposal start up while your head is pushed against it will cause decapitation, it might terrify a number of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience.</p>

The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm warranty that the unique function will not fail. Depending on the water source, you might have to filter turbid water or decontaminate bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening unit.
