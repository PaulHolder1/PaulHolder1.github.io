When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. If allowed to re-enter the water supply, there is potential for the polluted water to become a health danger. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for effectiveness, along with inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
