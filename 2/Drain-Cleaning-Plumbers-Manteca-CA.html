<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads end up being loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium option removes the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
