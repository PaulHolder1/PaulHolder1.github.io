<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation need, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
