Contamination may take place when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating & cooling system, into the potable water system. This can take place through a procedure called backflow.</p>
<p>The repair technician must be able to identify the lots of different producers and the specific designs produced for many years. Some models might seem comparable on the outdoors but could require various repair parts on the inside, so the repair technician should have the ability to determine the make, design and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that might have been produced.
