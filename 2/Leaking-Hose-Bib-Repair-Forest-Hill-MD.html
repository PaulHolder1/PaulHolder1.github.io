<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion.

Given that opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released.
