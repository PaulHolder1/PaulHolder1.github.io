<p>Whenever you flush your toilet, you'll notice that water goes to fill up the bowl. Nevertheless, in a properly working toilet, the water needs to stop running when the bowl is filled to its suitable capacity. If your toilet continues to run, opportunities are you have an internal leak and water is being disposed down the overflow. These leaks are incredibly inefficient, as more than a hundred gallons of water wind up taking a trip through the overflow.</p>
<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current dual flush HET offered by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.
