<h3>How To Repair A Leaking Kitchen Faucet at Pendleton IN</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
