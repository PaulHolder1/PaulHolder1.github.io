<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is an individual preference. An authorization is not required for repairs which include only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages supplied modifications are not made in the existing piping or components. A normal water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, large brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a close-by drain or drywell.</p>

Derek snaked the laundry line and outdoors kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He was able to get a snake around the "Y", which many plumbers state they can't do, and clear the line.
