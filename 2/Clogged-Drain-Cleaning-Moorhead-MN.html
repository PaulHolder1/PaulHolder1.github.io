<p>Noticeable odor. The moment you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like odor) in the yard, basement, or anywhere in your home or service place, provide us a call. That smell may be coming from your sewer system, which needs repair right away. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that removes sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and manages air pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually stopped working, it will typically need to be changed rather than fixed.
