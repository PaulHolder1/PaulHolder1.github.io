Our plumbers understand the ideal methods to clear the drains from these issues. There is no other way to shower when the water will not drain from the shower tray. We will have your drains cleared quickly, so you can when again shower.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might need to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug kit that I purchased separately from the disposal system. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>5. Pour hot water down your drain after utilizing the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, wash your drain with a bit of hot water. Whether tree roots have made their method into your pipes or you flushed something you should not have, a clogged toilet is never a pleasant experience. Thankfully, you do not always need the help of a professional to fix it.</p>
