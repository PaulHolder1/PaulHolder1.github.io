<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service in Prince Frederick MD?</h3>
<p>Domestic water that arrives to your Ohio home brings minerals that can trigger rust on metal parts and parts. To avoid deterioration from rust, storage tanks are geared up with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod protects the tank by drawing in harmful materials. By having the anode rod inspected frequently and replaced as required, you can double the life of your water heater.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of home centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>

Most plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with most disposal setups running $50 per hour for 3 hours total, making the labor costs roughly $150.</p>
