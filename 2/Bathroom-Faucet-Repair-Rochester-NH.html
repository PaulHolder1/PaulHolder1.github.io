Salt costs $4 to $6 per bag. A hydro jetter is a pump-and-hose system that uses high-powered water jets to clear residential and commercial drain pipes. Many high-pressure water jetters will run with as much as 4,000 PSI of pressure and will push anywhere from 2-18 gallons of water per minute through a pipe.</p>
