<p>After getting here after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together however declared they would not take obligation if it dripped now because of some unspecified oddities in how my sink was put together. After they gave me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, given that I never ever wish to see this company again.</p>
