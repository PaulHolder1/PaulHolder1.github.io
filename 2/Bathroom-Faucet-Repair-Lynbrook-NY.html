<p>When the data collected from the field test suggests the assembly has degraded in its performance below the established minimum standard, backflow preventers need to only be repaired. The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if needed, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to degrade in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working requirements. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
