Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed.
