<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX.

Repiping is the very best solution to all of these issues.</p>

<h3>Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in West Linn OR</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
