<p>Backsiphonage can take place when there is a sudden reduction in the water pressure of the distribution system, such as during fire combating or when a water pipe breaks. At these occurances, water circulation can be reversed. This turnaround can create a suction result and draw possible pollutants into the potable (drinking) water system. Storage tank water heaters are commonly discovered in many houses. Their components are an insulated tank, normally holding 30-50 gallons of water, to heat and store the water until it's needed. A pipe emerges from the top to deliver hot water to its location, kitchen, bathroom, or other sinks.</p>
