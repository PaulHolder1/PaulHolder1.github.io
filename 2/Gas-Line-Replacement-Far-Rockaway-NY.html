<p>106.2.1 Fixing Leaks. The stopping of leaks in drains, water, soil, waste or vent pipe, offered that if any concealed trap, drainpipe, water, soil, waste or vent pipe becomes malfunctioning and it becomes required to eliminate and replace the exact same with new product, such work shall be thought about as new work and a permit shall be gotten and an inspection made as supplied in this Code, based on the provisions stated in Section 106.2.2.</p>
<p>To determine which toilet valve is causing the problem, look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overflowing into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, consistent outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing entirely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water stains and deterioration. But do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
