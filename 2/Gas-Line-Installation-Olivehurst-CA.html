<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Olivehurst CA</h3>
<p>Plumbing and piping technology has improved over the last thirty years. Copper has been the preferred option to replace galvanized iron pipes (which utilized to be considered very strong, however they were discovered to split under pressure and tend to rust within a couple of years). Today, many quality contractors use PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
