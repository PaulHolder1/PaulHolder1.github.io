<p>Metal alloys are vulnerable to an electro-chemical condition called rust. Corrosion can actually consume a metal away causing the metal to not be as strong as it initially was or change the tolerances triggering parts to not operate in a backflow preventer.

<p>During normal operation, the pressure in between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of reduced pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is developed to open and release water to the exterior. An RPZ will regularly discharge percentages of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be installed in areas that are not subject to water damage and allow appropriate drainage.</p>
