<p>106.2.1 Fixing Leaks. The stopping of leaks in drains, water, soil, waste or vent pipe, supplied that if any concealed trap, drainpipe, water, soil, waste or vent pipe ends up being malfunctioning and it ends up being needed to remove and replace the same with new material, such work shall be thought about as new work and an authorization will be obtained and an inspection made as offered in this Code, based on the arrangements stated in Section 106.2.2.</p>
<p>When selecting the appropriate system protection there are a number of factors to consider we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be taken a look at on a private basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of lawn sprinkler consists of the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire security system are designed to match the hazard that exists in the areas they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be very various, we need to comprehend that the fire defense system for any installation requires to be designed and installed to meet that specific hazard or need. An aircraft garage will need a very different fire defense system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow defense requirements for these 2 examples would also vary greatly.</p>
