<p>This is a totally valid question that we hear a lot. The disposal system is not, naturally, as crucial as your water heater, water line, or drainpipes. Nevertheless, it adds a reasonable amount of functionality to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a reasonably small cylindrical device installed under the kitchen drain. When turned on, your disposal system pulls down wastewater and any material particles by centrifugal force. However it does not shred such debris. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly flow into the drain pipe together with the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>While some of these items appear harmless enough, they can all add to harming the grinding system or obstructing and jamming the disposal. It is a great idea always to use cold water when running the waste disposal unit, and you can use lemon or orange rinds to help clean and freshen the drain. At A&A Plumbing, our techs are experts with garbage disposals and can identify and repair your problem with ease.</p>
