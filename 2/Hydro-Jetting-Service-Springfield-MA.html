<p>After getting here after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen tossed up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together however claimed they would not take responsibility if it dripped now since of some unspecified curiosity in how my sink was assembled. After they provided me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and expect the very best is typical in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
