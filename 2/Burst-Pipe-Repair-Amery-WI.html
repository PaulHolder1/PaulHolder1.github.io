<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. An action team is offered for preliminary examination of sewer emergencies every day of the year. Call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance staff at (503) 823-1700 if sewage from the City-maintained part of the sewer system backs up through toilets or sinks. City workers will examine and eliminate obstructions in the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line that the City is accountable for. If the problem is the result of excessive storm water in the system, you might have to wait till the storm has actually gone away to have the backup solved.</p>

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and figure out the reason for the problem. The line was plainly degrading; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line could collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
