<p>IRWD is committed to providing safe, high quality water to clients. Our extensive water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water delivered to our clients is kept devoid of harmful impurities. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices consisting of a nonpotable compound, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination may occur when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating and cooling system, into the safe and clean water system. This can occur through a process called backflow.</p>

When this takes place, the Relief Valve Spring presses back versus the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest dual flush HET used by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.
